<small>HEIDI'S FIRST MOUNTAIN CLIMB</small></p>


<p>On a bright June morning two figures&mdash;one a tall girl and
the other a child&mdash;could be seen climbing a narrow
mountain path that winds up from the pretty village of
Mayenfeld, to the lofty heights of the Alm mountain. In
spite of the hot June sun the child was clothed as if to keep
off the bitterest frost. She did not look more than five years
old, but what her natural figure was like would be hard to
say, for she had on apparently two dresses, one above the
other, and over these a thick red woolen shawl. Her small
feet were shod in thick, nailed mountain-shoes.</p>

<p>When the wayfarers came to the hamlet known as
Doerfli, which is situated half-way up the mountain, they
met with greetings from all sides, for the elder girl was now
in her old home. As they were leaving the village, a voice
called out: "Wait a moment, Dete; if you are going on up
the mountain, I will come along with you."</p>

<p>The girl thus addressed stood still, and the child immediately
let go her hand and seated herself on the ground.</p>

<p>"Are you tired, Heidi?" asked her companion.</p>

<p>"No, I am hot," answered the child.</p>

<p>"We shall soon get to the top now. You must walk
bravely on a little longer, and take good, long steps, and in
another hour we shall be there," said Dete.</p>

<p>They were now joined by a stout, good-natured looking
woman, who walked on ahead with her old acquaintance.</p>

<p>"And where are you going with the child?" asked the
one who had just joined the party. "I suppose it is the child
your sister left?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Dete. "I am taking her up to Uncle,
where she must stay."</p>

<p>"This child stay up there with Alm-Uncle! You must
be out of your senses, Dete! How can you think of such a
thing! The old man, however, will soon send you both packing
off home again!"</p>

<p>"He cannot very well do that, seeing that he is her grandfather.
He must do something for her. I have had the charge
of the child till now, and I can tell you, Barbel, I am not going
to give up the chance which has just fallen to me of getting a
good place, for her sake."</p>

<p>"That would be all very well if he were like other people,"
said Barbel, "but you know what he is. And what can
he do with a child, especially with one so young! The child
cannot possibly live with him. But where are you thinking
of going yourself?"</p>

<p>"To Frankfurt, where an extra good place awaits me,"
answered Dete.</p>

<!--p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span></p-->

<p>"I am glad I am not the child," exclaimed Barbel. "Not
a creature knows anything about the old man up there. He
will have nothing to do with anybody, and never sets his foot
inside a church from one year's end to another. When he does
come down once in a while, everybody clears out of his way.
The mere sight of him, with his bushy, grey eyebrows and
immense beard, is alarming enough. All kinds of things are
said about him. You, Dete, however, must certainly have
learnt a good deal concerning him from your sister."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I am not going to repeat what I heard. Suppose
it should come to his ears. I should get into no end of
trouble about it."</p>

<p>Barbel put her arm through Dete's in a confidential sort
of way, and said: "Now do just tell me what is wrong with
the old man. Was he always shunned as he is now, and was he
always so cross? I assure you I will hold my tongue if you
will tell me."</p>

<p>"Very well then, I will tell you&mdash;but just wait a moment,"
said Dete, looking around for Heidi who had slipped
away unnoticed.</p>

<p>"I see where she is," exclaimed Barbel, "look over
there!" and she pointed to a spot far away from the footpath.
"She is climbing up the slope yonder with Peter and his
goats. But tell me about the old man. Did he ever have anything
more than his two goats and his hut?"</p>

<p>"I should think so indeed," replied Dete with animation;
"he was at one time the owner of one of the largest farms in
Domleschg, where my mother used to live. But he drank and
gambled away the whole of his property, and when this became
known to his mother and father they died of sorrow, one
shortly after the other. Uncle, having nothing left to him but
his bad name, disappeared and it was heard that he had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>
to Naples as a soldier. After twelve or fifteen years he reappeared
in Domleschg, bringing with him a young son whom
he tried to place with some of his kinspeople. Every door,
however, was shut in his face, for no one wished to have any
more to do with him. Embittered by this treatment, he vowed
never to set foot in Domleschg again, and he then came to
Doerfli where he lived with his little boy. His wife, it seemed,
had died shortly after the child's birth. He must have accumulated
some money during his absence, for he apprenticed
his son Tobias to a carpenter. He was a steady lad, and kindly
received by every one in Doerfli. His father, however, was
still looked upon with suspicion, and it was even rumored that
he had killed a man in some brawl at Naples."</p>

<p>"But why does everyone call him Uncle? Surely he
can't be uncle to everyone living in Doerfli," asked Barbel.</p>

<p>"Our grandmothers were related, so we used to call him
Uncle, and as my father had family connections with so many
people in Doerfli, soon everyone fell into the habit of calling
him Uncle," explained Dete.</p>

<p>"And what happened to Tobias," further questioned
Barbel, who was listening with deep interest.</p>

<p>"Tobias was taught his trade in Mels, and when he had
served his apprenticeship he came back to Doerfli and married
my sister Adelaide. But their happiness did not last
long. Two years after their marriage Tobias was killed in an
accident. His wife was so overcome with grief that she fell
into a fever from which she never recovered. She had always
been rather delicate and subject to curious attacks, during
which no one knew whether she was awake or sleeping. And
so two months after Tobias had been carried to the grave,
his wife followed him. Their sad fate was the talk of everybody
far and near, and the general opinion was expressed that
it was a punishment which Uncle deserved for the godless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>
life he had led. Our minister endeavored to awaken his conscience,
but the old man grew only more wrathful and stubborn
and would not speak to a soul. All at once we heard that
he had gone to live up on the Alm mountain and that he did
not intend to come down again. Since then he has led his
solitary life up there, and everyone knows him now by the
name of Alm-Uncle. Mother and I took Adelaide's little one,
then only a year old, into our care. When mother died last
year, and I went down to the Baths to earn some money, I
paid old Ursel to take care of her. So you see I have done my
duty, now it's Uncle's turn. But where are you going to yourself,
Barbel? We are now half way up the Alm."</p>

<p>"We have just reached the place I wanted," answered
Barbel. "I must see Peter's mother who is doing some
spinning for me. So, good-bye, Dete, and good luck to you."</p>

<p>She went toward a small, dark brown hut, which stood a
few steps away from the path in a hollow that afforded it
some protection from the mountain wind.</p>

<p>Here lived Peter, the eleven-year-old boy, with his
mother Brigitta and his blind grandmother who was known
to all the old and young in the neighborhood as just "Grandmother."</p>

<p>Every morning Peter went down to Doerfli to bring up
a flock of goats to browse on the mountain. At sundown he
went skipping down the mountain again with his light-footed
animals. When he reached Doerfli he would give a
shrill whistle, whereupon all the owners of the goats would
come out to take home the animals that belonged to them.</p>

<p>Dete had been standing for a good ten minutes looking
about her in every direction for some sign of the children and
the goats. Meanwhile Heidi and the goatherd were climbing
up by a far and roundabout way, for Peter knew many spots
where all kinds of good food, in the shape of shrubs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>
plants, grew for his goats. The child, exhausted with the heat
and weight of her thick clothes, panted and struggled after
him, at first with some difficulty. She said nothing, but her
little eyes kept watching first Peter, as he sprang nimbly
hither and thither on his bare feet, clad only in his short, light
breeches, and then the slim-legged goats that went leaping
over rocks and shrubs. All at once she sat down on the
ground, and began pulling off her shoes and stockings. Then
she unwound the hot red shawl and took off her frock. But
there was still another to unfasten, for Dete had put the Sunday
dress on over the everyday one, to save the trouble of
carrying it. Quick as lightning the everyday frock followed
the other, and now the child stood up, clad only in her light
short-sleeved under garment. She stretched out her little
bare arms with glee. Leaving all her clothes together in a
tidy little heap, she went jumping and climbing up after Peter
and the goats as nimbly as any of the party.</p>

<p>Now that Heidi was able to move at her ease, she began
to enter into conversation with Peter. She asked him how
many goats he had, where he was going to with them, and
what he had to do when he arrived there. At last, after some
time, they came within view of Dete. Hardly had the latter
caught sight of the little company climbing up towards her
when she shrieked out: "Heidi, what have you been doing!
What a sight you have made of yourself! And where are your
two frocks and the red wrapper? And the new shoes I bought,
and the new stockings I knitted for you&mdash;everything gone!
not a thing left! What can you have been thinking of, Heidi;
where are all your clothes?"</p>

<p>The child quietly pointed to a spot below on the mountain
side and answered, "Down there."</p>

<p>"You good-for-nothing little thing!" exclaimed Dete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>
angrily, "what could have put it into your head to do that?
What made you undress yourself? What do you mean by it?"</p>

<p>"I don't want any clothes," said Heidi.</p>


<p>"You wretched, thoughtless child! have you no sense in
you at all?" continued Dete, scolding and lamenting. "Peter,
you go down and fetch them for me as quickly as you can, and
you shall have something nice," and she held out a bright new
piece of money to him that sparkled in the sun. Peter was immediately
off down the steep mountain side, taking the shortest
cut, and was back again so quickly with the clothes that
even Dete was obliged to give him a word of praise as she
handed him the promised money. Peter promptly thrust it
into his pocket and his face beamed with delight, for it was
not often that he was the happy possessor of such riches.</p>

<p>"You can carry the things up for me as far as Uncle's, as
you are going the same way," went on Dete, who was preparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>
to continue her climb up the mountain side, which rose in
a steep ascent immediately behind the goatherd's hut. Peter
willingly undertook to do this, and followed after her. After
a climb of more than three-quarters of an hour they reached
the top of the Alm mountain. Uncle's hut stood on a projection
of the rock, exposed indeed to the winds, but where every
ray of sun could rest upon it, and a full view could be had of
the valley beneath. Behind the hut stood three old fir trees,
with long, thick, unlopped branches. Beyond these rose a
further wall of mountain, the lower heights still overgrown
with beautiful grass and plants.</p>

<p>Against the hut, on the side looking towards the valley,
Uncle had put up a seat. Here he was sitting, his pipe in his
mouth and his hands on his knees, quietly looking out, when
the children, the goats, and Dete suddenly clambered into
view. Heidi was at the top first. She went straight up to the
old man, put out her hand, and said, "Good-evening, Grandfather."</p>

<p>"So, so, what is the meaning of this?" he asked gruffly,
as he gave the child an abrupt shake of the hand, and gazed
at her from under his bushy eyebrows. Heidi stared steadily
back at him in return with unflinching gaze. Meanwhile Dete
had come up, with Peter after her.</p>

<p>"I wish you good-day, Uncle," said Dete, as she walked
towards him, "and I have brought you Tobias and Adelaide's
child. You will hardly recognize her, as you have never seen
her since she was a year old."</p>

<p>"And what has the child to do with me up here?" asked
the old man curtly. "You there," he then called out to Peter,
"be off with your goats, you are none too early as it is, and
take mine with you."</p>

<p>Peter obeyed on the instant and quickly disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span></p>

<p>"The child is here to remain with you," Dete made
answer. "I have done my duty by her for these four years,
and now it is time for you to do yours."</p>

<p>"That's it, is it?" said the old man, as he looked at her
with a flash in his eye. "And when the child begins to fret
and whine after you, what am I to do with her then?"</p>

<p>"That's your affair," retorted Dete. "If you cannot arrange
to keep her, do with her as you like. You will be
answerable for the result if harm happens to her, though you
have hardly need to add to the burden already on your
conscience."</p>

<p>Now Dete was not quite easy in her own conscience about
what she was doing, and consequently was feeling hot and
irritable, and said more than she had intended. As she uttered
her last words, Uncle rose from his seat. He looked at her in
a way that made her draw back a step or two, then flinging out
his arm, he said to her in a commanding voice: "Be off with
you this instant, and get back as quickly as you can to the
place whence you came, and do not let me see your face again
in a hurry."</p>

<p>Dete did not wait to be told twice. "Good-bye to you
then, and to you too, Heidi," she called, as she turned quickly
away and started to descend the mountain at a running pace,
which she did not slacken till she found herself safely again at
Doerfli.</p>

<small>A NEW HOME WITH GRANDFATHER</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A<span class="smcap">s</span> soon as Dete had disappeared the old man went back
to his bench, and there he remained seated, staring at
the ground without uttering a sound, while thick curls of
smoke floated upward from his pipe. Heidi, meanwhile, was
enjoying herself in her new surroundings; she looked about
till she found a shed, built against the hut, where the goats
were kept; she peeped in, and saw it was empty. She continued
her search but presently came back to where her
grandfather was sitting. Seeing that he was in exactly the
same position as when she left him, she went and placed herself
in front of the old man and said:</p>

<p>"I want to see what you have inside the house."</p>

<p>"Come then!" and the grandfather rose and went before
her towards the hut.</p>

<p>"Bring your bundle of clothes in with you," he bid her
as she was following.</p>

<p>"I shan't want them any more," was her prompt answer.</p>

<p>The old man turned and looked searchingly at the child,
whose dark eyes were sparkling in delighted anticipation of
what she was going to see inside. "She is certainly not wanting
in intelligence," he murmured to himself. "And why
shall you not want them any more?" he asked aloud.</p>

<p>"Because I want to go about like the goats with their
thin light legs."</p>

<p>"Well, you can do so if you like," said her grandfather,
"but bring the things in, we must put them in the cupboard."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span></p>

<p>Heidi did as she was told. The old man now opened the
door and Heidi stepped inside after him; she found herself in
a good-sized room, which covered the whole ground floor of the
hut. A table and a chair were the only furniture; in one corner
stood the grandfather's bed, in another was the hearth
with a large kettle hanging above it; and on the further side
was a large door in the wall&mdash;this was the cupboard. The
grandfather opened it; inside were his clothes. On a second
shelf were some plates and cups and glasses, and on a higher
one still, a round loaf, smoked meat, and cheese, for everything
that Alm-Uncle needed for his food and clothing was
kept in this cupboard. Heidi thrust in her bundle of clothes,
as far back behind her grandfather's things as possible, so that
they might not easily be found again. She then looked carefully
round the room, and asked, "Where am I to sleep, Grandfather?"</p>

<p>"Wherever you like," he answered.</p>

<p>Heidi was delighted, and began at once to examine all the
nooks and corners to find out where it would be pleasantest to
sleep. In the corner near her grandfather's bed she saw a
short ladder against the wall; up she climbed and found
herself in the hay-loft. There lay a large heap of fresh, sweet-smelling
hay, while through a round window in the wall she
could see right down the valley.</p>

<p>"I shall sleep up here, Grandfather," she called down to
him, "it's lovely, up here. Come up and see how lovely it is!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know all about it," he called up in answer.</p>

<p>"I am getting the bed ready now," she called down
again, as she went busily to and fro at her work, "but I shall
want you to bring me up a sheet; you can't have a bed without
a sheet; you want it to lie upon."</p>

<p>"All right," said the grandfather, and presently he went
to the cupboard, and after rummaging about inside for a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>
minutes he drew out a long, coarse piece of stuff, which was
all he had to do duty for a sheet. He carried it up to the loft,
where he found Heidi had already made quite a nice bed. She
had put an extra heap of hay at one end for a pillow, and had
so arranged it that, when in bed, she would be able to see comfortably
out through the round window.</p>

<p>"That is capital," said her grandfather; "now we must
put on the sheet."</p>

<p>They spread it over the bed, and where it was too long or
too broad, Heidi quickly tucked it in under the hay. It looked
as tidy and comfortable a bed as you could wish for, and Heidi
stood gazing thoughtfully at her handiwork.</p>

<p>"We have forgotten something now, Grandfather," she
said after a short silence.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A coverlid; when you get into bed, you have to creep in
between the sheet and the coverlid."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the way, is it? But suppose I have not got a
coverlid?" said the old man.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind, Grandfather," said Heidi in a consoling
tone of voice, "I can take some more hay to put over me,"
and she was turning quickly to fetch another armful from the
heap, when her grandfather stopped her. "Wait a moment,"
he said, and he climbed down the ladder again and went towards
his bed. He returned to the loft with a large, thick
sack, made of flax, which he laid tidily over the bed.</p>

<p>"That is a splendid coverlid," said Heidi, "and the bed
looks lovely altogether! I wish it was night, so that I might
get inside it at once."</p>

<p>"I think we had better go down and have something to
eat first," said the grandfather.</p>

<p>While the kettle was boiling the old man held a large
piece of cheese on a long iron fork over the fire, turning it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
round and round till it was toasted a nice golden yellow color
on each side. Heidi watched all that was going on with eager
curiosity. Suddenly some new idea seemed to come into her
head, for she turned and ran to the cupboard, and then began
going busily backwards and forwards. Presently the grandfather
got up and came to the table with a jug and the cheese,
and there he saw it already tidily laid with the round loaf and
two plates and two knives each in its right place.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's right," said the grandfather, "I am glad to
see that you have some ideas of your own," and as he spoke
he laid the toasted cheese on a layer of bread, "but there is
still something missing."</p>

<p>Heidi looked at the jug that was steaming away invitingly,
and ran quickly back to the cupboard. At first she could
only see a small bowl left on the shelf, but she was not long in
perplexity, for a moment later she caught sight of two glasses
further back, and without an instant's loss of time she returned
with these and the bowl and put them down on the
table.</p>

<p>"Good, I see you know how to set about things; but what
will you do for a seat?" The grandfather himself was sitting
on the only chair in the room. Heidi flew to the hearth, and
dragging the three-legged stool up to the table, sat herself
down upon it.</p>

<p>The grandfather filled the bowl with milk, and pushed it
in front of Heidi. Then he brought her a large slice of bread
and a piece of the golden cheese, and told her to eat. Heidi
lifted the bowl with both hands and drank without pause till it
was empty, for the thirst of all her long, hot journey had returned
upon her. Then she drew a deep breath&mdash;in the eagerness
of her thirst she had not stopped to breathe&mdash;and put
down the bowl.</p>

<p>"Was the milk nice?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span></p>

<p>"I never drank any so good before," answered Heidi.</p>

<p>"Then you must have some more," and the old man filled
her bowl again to the brim and set it before the child, who was
now hungrily beginning her bread, having first spread it with
the cheese, which after being toasted was soft as butter. The
meal being over, the grandfather went outside to put the goat-shed
in order, and Heidi watched with interest while he
first swept it out, and then put fresh straw for the goats to
sleep upon. Then he went to the little well-shed, and there he
cut some long, round sticks, and a small, round board; in this
he bored some holes and stuck the sticks into them, and there,
as if made by magic, was a three-legged stool just like her
grandfather's, only higher. Heidi stood and looked at it,
speechless with astonishment.</p>

<p>"What do you think that is?" asked her grandfather.</p>

<p>"It's my stool, I know, because it is such a high one; and
it was made all of a minute," said the child, still lost in wonder
and admiration.</p>

<p>"She understands what she sees, her eyes are in the right
place," remarked the grandfather to himself.</p>

<p>And so the time passed happily on till evening. Then the
wind began to roar louder than ever through the old fir trees;
Heidi listened with delight to the sound, and it filled her heart
so full of gladness that she skipped and danced round the old
trees, as if some unheard of joy had come to her. The grandfather
stood and watched her from the shed.</p>


<p>Suddenly a shrill whistle was heard. Down from the
heights above, the goats came springing one after another,
with Peter in their midst. Heidi sprang forward with a cry
of joy and rushed among the flock, greeting first one and then
another of her old friends of the morning. As they neared the
hut the goats stood still, and then two of their number, two
beautiful, slender animals, one white and one brown, ran forward
to where the grandfather was standing and began licking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>
his hands, for he was holding a little salt which he always
had ready for his goats on their return home. Peter went on
down the mountain with the remainder of his flock. Heidi
tenderly stroked the two goats in turn, jumping about in her
glee at the pretty little animals. "Are they ours, Grandfather?
Are they both ours? Are you going to put them in
the shed? Will they always stay with us?"</p>

<p>Heidi's questions came tumbling out one after the other,
so that her grandfather had only time to answer each of them
with "Yes, yes." When the goats had finished licking up the
salt her grandfather told her to go and fetch her bowl and the
bread.</p>

<p>Heidi obeyed and was soon back again. The grandfather
milked the white goat and filled her basin, and then breaking
off a piece of bread, "Now eat your supper," he said, "and
then go up to bed. Dete left another little bundle for you with
a nightgown and other small things in it, which you will find
at the bottom of the cupboard if you want them. I must go
and shut up the goats, so be off and sleep well."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Grandfather! good-night. What are their
names, Grandfather, what are their names?" she called out
as she ran after his retreating figure and the goats.</p>

<p>"The white one is named Little Swan, and the brown one
Little Bear," he answered.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Little Swan, good-night, Little Bear!" she
called again at the top of her voice. Then she ate her supper
and went indoors and climbed up to her bed, where she was
soon lying as sweetly and soundly asleep as any young princess
on her couch of silk.</p>

<small>LITTLE BEAR AND LITTLE SWAN</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">H<span class="smcap">eidi</span> felt very happy next morning as she woke up in her
new home and remembered all the many things that she
had seen the day before and which she would see again that
day, and above all she thought with delight of the dear goats.
She jumped quickly out of bed and a very few minutes sufficed
her to put on the clothes which she had taken off the night
before, for there were not many of them. Then she climbed
down the ladder and ran outside the hut. There stood Peter
already with his flock of goats, and the grandfather was just
bringing his two out of the shed to join the others. Heidi ran
forward to wish good-morning to him and the goats.</p>

<p>"Do you want to go with them on to the mountain?"
asked her grandfather. Nothing could have pleased Heidi
better, and she jumped for joy in answer.</p>

<p>The grandfather went inside the hut, calling to Peter to
follow him and bring in his wallet. Peter obeyed with astonishment,
and laid down the little bag which held his meagre
dinner.</p>

<p>"Open it," said the old man, and he put in a large piece of
bread and an equally large piece of cheese, which made Peter
open his eyes, for each was twice the size of the two portions
which he had for his own dinner.</p>

<p>"There, now there is only the little bowl to add," continued
the grandfather, "for the child cannot drink her milk
as you do from the goat; she is not accustomed to that. You
must milk two bowlfuls for her when she has her dinner, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>
she is going with you and will remain with you till you return
this evening; but take care she does not fall over any of the
rocks, do you hear?"</p>

<p>They started joyfully for the mountain. Heidi went
running hither and thither and shouting with delight, for
here were whole patches of delicate red primroses, and there
the blue gleam of the lovely gentian, while above them all
laughed and nodded the tender-leaved golden cistus. Enchanted
with all this waving field of brightly-colored flowers,
Heidi forgot even Peter and the goats. She ran on in front
and then off to the side, tempted first one way and then the
other, as she caught sight of some bright spot of glowing red
or yellow. And all the while she was plucking whole handfuls
of the flowers which she put into her little apron, for she
wanted to take them all home and stick them in the hay, so
that she might make her bedroom look just like the meadows
outside. Peter had therefore to be on the alert, and his round
eyes, which did not move very quickly, had more work than
they could well manage, for the goats were as lively as Heidi;
they ran in all directions, and Peter had to follow whistling
and calling and swinging his stick to get all the runaways together
again.</p>

<p>Finally they arrived at the spot where Peter generally
halted for his goats to pasture and where he took up his quarters
for the day. It lay at the foot of the high rocks, which
were covered for some distance up by bushes and fir trees,
beyond which rose their bare and rugged summits. On one
side of the mountain the rock was split into deep clefts, and
the grandfather had reason to warn Peter of danger. Having
climbed as far as the halting-place, Peter unslung his wallet
and put it carefully in a little hollow of the ground, for he
knew what the wind was like up there and did not want to see
his precious belonging sent rolling down the mountain by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>
sudden gust. Then he threw himself at full length on the
warm ground, and soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>Heidi meanwhile had unfastened her apron and rolling it
carefully round the flowers laid it beside Peter's wallet inside
the hollow; she then sat down beside his outstretched figure
and looked about her.</p>

<p>The goats were climbing about among the bushes overhead.
She had never felt so happy in her life before. She
drank in the golden sunlight, the fresh air, the sweet smell of
the flowers, and wished for nothing better than to remain
there forever. Suddenly she heard a loud, harsh cry overhead
and lifting her eyes she saw a bird, larger than any she had
ever seen before, with great, spreading wings, wheeling round
in wide circles, and uttering a piercing, croaking kind of
sound above her.</p>

<p>"Peter, Peter, wake up!" called out Heidi. "See, the
great bird is there&mdash;look, look!"</p>

<p>Peter got up on hearing her call, and together they sat
and watched the bird, which rose higher and higher in the
blue air till it disappeared behind the grey mountain-tops.</p>

<p>"Where has it gone to?" asked Heidi, who had followed
the bird's movements with intense interest.</p>

<p>"Home to its nest," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Is his home right up there? Oh, how nice to be up so
high! why does he make that noise?"</p>

<p>"Because he can't help it," explained Peter.</p>

<p>"Let us climb up there and see where his nest is," proposed
Heidi.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! oh!" exclaimed Peter, his disapproval of
Heidi's suggestion becoming more marked with each ejaculation,
"why, even the goats cannot climb as high as that, besides
didn't Uncle say that you were not to fall over the
rocks."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span></p>

<p>Peter now began suddenly whistling and calling in such a
loud manner that Heidi could not think what was happening;
but the goats evidently understood his voice, for one after the
other they came springing down the rocks until they were all
assembled on the green plateau.</p>


<p>Heidi jumped up and ran in and out among them, for it
was new to her to see the goats playing together like this.
Meanwhile Peter had taken the wallet out of the hollow and
placed the pieces of bread and cheese on the ground in the
shape of a square, the larger two on Heidi's side and the
smaller on his own, for he knew exactly which were hers and
which his. Then he took the little bowl and milked some delicious,
fresh milk into it from the white goat, and afterwards
set the bowl in the middle of the square.</p>

<p>"Leave off jumping about, it is time for dinner," said
Peter; "sit down now and begin."</p>

<p>Heidi sat down. "Is the milk for me?" she asked.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," replied Peter, "and the two large pieces of bread
and cheese are yours also, and when you have drunk up that
milk, you are to have another bowlful from the white goat,
and then it will be my turn."</p>

<p>"And which do you get your milk from," inquired Heidi.</p>

<p>"From my own goat, the piebald one. But go on now
with your dinner," said Peter, again reminding her it was
time to eat. Heidi took up the bowl and drank her milk, and
as soon as she had put it down empty Peter rose and filled it
again for her. Then she broke off a piece of her bread and
held out the remainder, which was still larger than Peter's
own piece, together with the whole big slice of cheese to her
companion, saying, "You can have that, I have plenty."</p>

<p>Peter looked at Heidi, unable to speak for astonishment.
He hesitated a moment, for he could not believe that Heidi
was in earnest; but the latter kept on holding out the bread
and cheese, and as Peter still did not take it, she laid it down
on his knees. He saw then that she really meant it; he seized
the food, nodded his thanks and acceptance of her present,
and then made a more splendid meal than he had known ever
since he was a goat-herd. Heidi the while still continued to
watch the goats. "Tell me all their names," she said.</p>

<p>Peter knew these by heart, so he began, telling Heidi the
name of each goat in turn as he pointed it out to her. She
listened with great attention, and it was not long before she
could herself distinguish the goats from one another and could
call each by name, for every goat had its own peculiarities
which could not easily be mistaken. There was the great
Turk with his big horns, who was always wanting to butt the
others, so that most of them ran away when they saw him
coming and would have nothing to do with their rough companion.
Only Greenfinch, the slender, nimble, little goat, was
brave enough to face him, and would make a rush at him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
three or four times in succession. Then there was little White
Snowflake, who bleated in such a plaintive and beseeching
manner that Heidi already had several times run to it and
taken its head in her hands to comfort it. Just at this moment
the pleading young cry was heard again, and Heidi jumped
up running and, putting her arms around the little creature's
neck, asked in a sympathetic voice, "What is it, little Snowflake?
Why do you call like that as if in trouble?" The goat
pressed closer to Heidi in a confiding way and left off bleating.
Peter called out from where he was sitting&mdash;for he had not
yet got to the end of his bread and cheese&mdash;"she cries like that
because the old goat is not with her; she was sold at Mayenfeld
the day before yesterday, and so will not come up the
mountain any more."</p>

<p>"Who is the old goat?" called Heidi back.</p>

<p>"Why, her mother, of course," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Where is the grandmother?" called Heidi again.</p>

<p>"She has none."</p>

<p>"And the grandfather?"</p>

<p>"She has none."</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor little Snowflake!" exclaimed Heidi, clasping
the animal gently to her, "but do not cry like that any
more; see now, I shall come up here with you every day, so
that you will not be alone any more, and if you want anything
you have only to come to me."</p>

<p>The goats were now beginning to climb the rocks again,
each seeking for the plants it liked in its own fashion, some
jumping over everything they met till they found what they
wanted, others going more carefully and cropping all the nice
leaves by the way, the Turk still now and then giving the
others a poke with his horns. Little Swan and Little Bear
clambered lightly up and never failed to find the best bushes,
and then they would stand gracefully poised on their pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>
legs, delicately nibbling at the leaves. Heidi stood with her
hands behind her back, carefully noting all they did.</p>

<p>"Peter," she said to the boy who had again thrown himself
down on the ground, "the prettiest of all the goats are
Little Swan and Little Bear."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know they are," was the answer. "Alm-Uncle
brushes them down and washes them and gives them salt, and
he has the nicest shed for them."</p>

<p>All of a sudden Peter leaped to his feet and ran hastily
after the goats. Heidi followed him as fast as she could, for
she was too eager to know what had happened to stay behind.
Peter dashed through the middle of the flock towards that
side of the mountain where the rocks fell perpendicularly to
a great depth below, and where any thoughtless goat, if it
went too near, might fall over and break all its legs. He had
caught sight of the inquisitive Greenfinch taking leaps in that
direction, and he was only just in time, for the animal had already
sprung to the edge of the abyss. All Peter could do
was to throw himself down and seize one of her hind legs.
Greenfinch, thus taken by surprise, began bleating furiously,
angry at being held so fast and prevented from continuing her
voyage of discovery. She struggled to get loose, and endeavored
so obstinately to leap forward that Peter shouted to
Heidi to come and help him, for he could not get up and was
afraid of pulling out the goat's leg altogether.</p>

<p>Heidi had already run up and she saw at once the danger
both Peter and the animal were in. She quickly gathered a
bunch of sweet-smelling leaves, and then, holding them under
Greenfinch's nose, said coaxingly, "Come, come, Greenfinch,
you must not be naughty! Look, you might fall down there
and break your leg, and that would give you dreadful pain!"</p>

<p>The young animal turned quickly and began contentedly
eating the leaves out of Heidi's hand. Meanwhile Peter got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>
on to his feet again and took hold of Greenfinch by the band
round her neck from which her bell was hung, and Heidi taking
hold of her in the same way on the other side, they led the
wanderer back to the rest of the flock that had remained
peacefully feeding. Peter, now he had his goat in safety,
lifted his stick in order to give her a good beating as punishment,
and Greenfinch seeing what was coming shrank back in
fear. But Heidi cried out, "No, no, Peter, you must not strike
her; see how frightened she is!"</p>

<p>"She deserves it," growled Peter, and again lifted his
stick. Then Heidi flung herself against him and cried indignantly,
"You have no right to touch her, it will hurt her,
let her alone!"</p>

<p>Peter looked with surprise at the commanding little
figure, whose dark eyes were flashing, and reluctantly he let
his stick drop. "Well, I will let her off if you will give me
some more of your cheese tomorrow," he said, for he was determined
to have something to make up to him for his fright.</p>

<p>"You shall have it all, tomorrow and every day, I do not
want it," replied Heidi, giving ready consent to his demand.
"And I will give you bread as well, a large piece like you had
today; but then you must promise never to beat Greenfinch,
or Snowflake, or any of the goats."</p>

<p>"All right," said Peter, "I don't care," which meant that
he would agree to the bargain, and let go of Greenfinch, who
joyfully sprang to join her companions.</p>

<p>And thus imperceptibly the day had crept on to its close,
and now the sun was on the point of sinking out of sight behind
the high mountains. Heidi was again sitting on the
ground, when all at once she sprang to her feet, "Peter! Peter!
everything is on fire! All the rocks are burning, and the great
snow mountain and the sky! O look, look! the high rock up
there is red with flame! O the beautiful, fiery snow! Stand up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span>
Peter! See, the fire has reached the great bird's nest! look at
the rocks! look at the fir trees! Everything, everything is on
fire!"</p>

<p>"It is always like that," said Peter composedly, continuing
to peel his stick; "but it is not really fire."</p>

<p>"What is it then?" cried Heidi.</p>

<p>"It gets like that of itself," explained Peter.</p>

<p>"Look, look!" cried Heidi in fresh excitement, "now they
have turned all rose color! Look at that one covered with
snow, and that with the high, pointed rocks! What do you
call them?"</p>

<p>"Mountains have not any names," he answered.</p>

<p>"O how beautiful, look at the crimson snow! And up
there on the rocks there are ever so many roses! Oh! now
they are turning grey! Oh! oh! now all the color has died
away! it's all gone, Peter." And Heidi sat down on the
ground looking as full of distress as if everything had really
come to an end.</p>

<p>"It will come again tomorrow," said Peter. "Get up, we
must go home now." He whistled to his goats and together
they all started on their homeward way.</p>

<p>"Is it like that every day, shall we see it every day when
we bring the goats up here?" asked Heidi, as she clambered
down the mountain at Peter's side; she waited eagerly for his
answer, hoping that he would tell her it was so.</p>

<p>"It is like that most days," he replied.</p>

<p>"But will it be like that tomorrow for certain?" Heidi
persisted.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, tomorrow for certain," Peter assured her in
answer.</p>

<p>Heidi now felt quite happy again, and her little brain
was so full of new impressions and new thoughts that she did
not speak any more until they had reached the hut. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>
grandfather was sitting under the fir trees, where he had put
up a new seat.</p>

<p>Heidi ran up to him, followed by the white and brown
goats, for they knew their own master and stall. Peter called
out after her, "Come with me again tomorrow! Good-night!"
For he was anxious for more than one reason that Heidi
should go with him the next day.</p>

<p>"O, Grandfather," cried Heidi, "it was so beautiful. The
fire, and the roses on the rocks, and the blue and yellow
flowers, and look what I have brought you!" And opening
the apron that held her flowers she shook them all out at her
grandfather's feet. But the poor flowers, how changed they
were! Heidi hardly knew them again. They looked like dried
bits of hay, not a single little flower cup stood open. "O,
Grandfather, what is the matter with them?" exclaimed Heidi
in shocked surprise, "they were not like that this morning,
why do they look so now?"</p>

<p>"They like to stand out there in the sun and not to be shut
up in an apron," said her grandfather.</p>

<p>"Then I will never gather any more. But, Grandfather,
why did the great bird go on croaking so?" she continued in
an eager tone of inquiry.</p>

<p>"Go along now and get into your bath while I go and get
some milk; when we are together at supper I will tell you all
about it."</p>

<p>Heidi obeyed, and when later she was sitting on her high
stool before her milk bowl with her grandfather beside her,
she repeated her question, "Why does the great bird go on
croaking and screaming down at us, Grandfather?"</p>

<p>"He is mocking at the people who live down below in the
villages, because they all go huddling and gossipping together,
and encourage one another in evil talking and deeds. He
calls out, 'If you would separate and each go your own way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>
and come up here and live on a height as I do, it would be better
for you!'" there was almost a wildness in the old man's
voice as he spoke, so that Heidi seemed to hear the croaking
of the bird again even more distinctly.</p>

<p>"Why haven't the mountains any names?" Heidi
went on.</p>

<p>"They have names," answered her grandfather, "and if
you can describe one of them to me that I know I will tell you
what it is called."</p>

<p>Heidi then described to him the rocky mountain with the
two high peaks so exactly that the grandfather was delighted.
"Just so, I know it," and he told her its name.</p>

<p>Then Heidi told him of the mountain with the great snowfield,
and how it had been on fire.</p>

<p>The grandfather explained to her it was the sun that did
it. "When he says good-night to the mountains he throws his
most beautiful colors over them, so that they may not forget
him before he comes again the next day."</p>

<p>Heidi was delighted with this explanation, and could
hardly bear to wait for another day to come that she might
once more climb up with the goats and see how the sun bid
good-night to the mountains. But she had to go to bed first,
and all night she slept soundly on her bed of hay, dreaming of
nothing but of shining mountains with red roses all over them,
among which happy little Snowflake went leaping in and out.</p>

<small>SHOOTING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> next morning the sun came out early as bright as ever,
and then Peter appeared with the goats, and again the
two children climbed up together to the high meadows, and
so it went on day after day till Heidi, passing her life thus
among the grass and flowers, was burnt brown with the sun,
and grew so strong and healthy that nothing ever ailed her.
She was happy too, and lived from day to day as free and
lighthearted as the little birds that make their home among
the green forest trees. Then the autumn came, and the wind
blew louder and stronger, and the grandfather would say
sometimes, "Today you must stay at home, Heidi; a sudden
gust of the wind would blow a little thing like you over the
rocks into the valley below in a moment."</p>

<p>Whenever Peter heard that he must go alone he looked
very unhappy, for he saw nothing but mishaps of all kinds
ahead, and did not know how he should bear the long, dull
day without Heidi. Then, too, there was the good meal he
would miss, and besides that the goats on these days were so
naughty and obstinate that he had twice the usual trouble
with them, for they had grown so accustomed to Heidi's
presence that they would run in every direction and refuse to
go on unless she was with them. Heidi was never unhappy,
for wherever she was she found something to interest or
amuse her. She liked best, it is true, to go out with Peter up
to the flowers and the great bird, but she also found her grandfather's
hammering and sawing and carpentering very entertaining,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
and if it should chance to be the day when the large,
round goats'-milk cheese was made she enjoyed beyond
measure watching her grandfather stir the great cauldron.
The thing which attracted her most, however, was the waving
and roaring of the three old fir trees on these windy days. She
would stand underneath them and look up, unable to tear
herself away, looking and listening while they bowed and
swayed and roared as the mighty wind rushed through them.
There was no longer now the warm, bright sun that had shone
all through the summer, so Heidi went to the cupboard and
got out her shoes and stockings and dress.</p>

<p>Then it grew very cold, and Peter would come up early
in the morning blowing on his fingers to keep them warm.
But he soon left off coming, for one night there was a heavy
fall of snow and the next morning the whole mountain was
covered with it, and not a single little green leaf even was to
be seen anywhere upon it. There was no Peter that day, and
Heidi stood at the little window looking out in wonderment,
for the snow was beginning again, and the thick flakes kept
falling till the snow was up to the window, and still they continued
to fall, and the snow grew higher, so that at last the
window could not be opened, and she and her grandfather
were shut up fast within the hut. Heidi thought this was
great fun and ran from one window to the other. The next
day, the snow having ceased, the grandfather went out and
shoveled it away from the house, and threw it into such great
heaps that they looked like mountains.</p>

<p>Heidi and her grandfather were sitting one afternoon on
their three-legged stools before the fire when there came a
great thump at the door. It was Peter all white with snow
for he had had to fight his way through deep snowdrifts. He
had been determined, however, to climb up to the hut, for it
was a week now since he had seen Heidi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span></p>

<p>"Good-evening," he said as he came in; then he went and
placed himself as near the fire as he could, his whole face
beaming with pleasure at finding himself there. Heidi looked
on in astonishment, for Peter was beginning to thaw all over
with the warmth, so that he had the appearance of a trickling
waterfall.</p>

<p>"Well, General, how goes it with you?" said the grandfather,
"now that you have lost your army you will have to
turn to your pen and pencil."</p>

<p>"Why must he turn to his pen and pencil," asked Heidi
immediately, full of curiosity.</p>

<p>"During the winter he must go to school," explained her
grandfather, "and learn how to read and write; it's a bit hard,
although useful sometimes afterwards. Am I not right,
General?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," assented Peter.</p>

<p>Heidi's interest was now thoroughly awakened, and she
had so many questions to ask Peter about school, and the conversation
took so long that he had time to get thoroughly dry.</p>

<p>"Well, now, General, you have been under fire for some
time and must want some refreshment. Come and join us,"
said the grandfather as he brought the supper out of the cupboard,
and Heidi pushed the stools to the table. There was
also now a bench fastened against the wall, for as he was no
longer alone the grandfather had put up seats of various kinds
here and there, long enough to hold two persons, for Heidi
had a way of always keeping close to her grandfather whether
he was walking, sitting, or standing. Peter opened his round
eyes very wide when he saw what a large piece of meat Alm-Uncle
gave him on his thick slice of bread. It was a long time
since Peter had had anything so nice to eat. As soon as the
pleasant meal was over he began to get ready for returning
home, for it was already growing dark. He had said his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
"good-night" and his thanks, and was just going out, when he
turned and said, "I shall come again next Sunday, this day
week, and my grandmother sent word that she would like you
to come and see her some day."</p>

<p>It was quite a new idea to Heidi that she should go and
pay anybody a visit, and she could not get it out of her head;
so the first thing she said to her grandfather the next day was,
"I must go down to see the grandmother today, she will be expecting
me."</p>

<p>"The snow is too deep," answered the grandfather, trying
to put her off. Not a day passed but what she said five or
six times to her grandfather, "I must certainly go today, the
grandmother will be waiting for me."</p>

<p>On the fourth day, when Heidi was sitting on her high
stool at dinner with the bright sun shining in upon her
through the window, she again repeated her little speech, "I
must certainly go down to see the grandmother today, or else
I shall keep her waiting too long."</p>

<p>The grandfather rose from the table, climbed up to the
hayloft and brought down the thick sack that was Heidi's
coverlid, and said, "Come along then!" The child skipped
out gleefully after him into the glittering world of snow.</p>

<p>The old fir trees were standing now quite silent, their
branches covered with the white snow, and they looked so
lovely as they glittered and sparkled in the sunlight that
Heidi jumped for joy at the sight and kept on calling out,
"Come here, come here, Grandfather! The fir trees are all
silver and gold!" The grandfather had gone into the shed and
he now came out, dragging a large hand-sleigh; inside there
was a low seat, and the sleigh could be pushed forward and
guided by the feet of the one who sat upon it with the help of a
pole that was fastened to the side. The old man got in and
lifted the child on to his lap; then he wrapped her up in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>
sack, that she might keep nice and warm, and put his left arm
closely round her, for it was necessary to hold her tight during
the coming journey. He now grasped the pole with his right
hand and gave the sleigh a push forward with his two feet. It
shot down the mountain side with such rapidity that Heidi
thought they were flying through the air like a bird, and
shouted aloud with delight. Suddenly they came to a standstill,
and there they were at Peter's hut. Her grandfather
lifted her out and unwrapped her. "There you are, now go in,
and when it begins to grow dark you must start on your way
home again." Then he left her and went up the mountain,
pulling his sleigh after him.</p>

<p>Heidi opened the door of the hut and stepped into a tiny
room that looked very dark, with a fireplace and a few dishes
on a wooden shelf; this was the little kitchen. She opened
another door, and found herself in another small room, for the
place was not a herdsman's hut like her grandfather's, with
one large room on the ground floor and a hay-loft above, but
a very old cottage, where everything was narrow and poor and
shabby. A table was close to the door, and as Heidi stepped
in she saw a woman sitting at it, putting a patch on a waistcoat
which Heidi recognized at once as Peter's. In the corner
sat an old woman, bent with age, spinning. Heidi was quite
sure this was the grandmother, so she went up to the spinning-wheel
and said, "Good-day, Grandmother, I have come at
last; did you think I was a long time coming?"</p>

<p>The old woman raised her head and felt for the hand that
the child held out to her, and when she had found it, she
passed her own over it thoughtfully for a few seconds, and
then said, "Are you the child who lives up with Alm-Uncle,
are you Heidi?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," answered Heidi, "I have just come down in
the sleigh with grandfather."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span></p>

<p>"Is it possible! Why, your hands are quite warm!
Brigitta, did Alm-Uncle come himself with the child?"</p>

<p>Peter's mother had left her work and risen from the
table and now stood looking at Heidi with curiosity, scanning
her from head to foot. "I do not know, mother, whether
Uncle came himself; it is hardly likely, the child probably
makes a mistake."</p>

<p>But Heidi looked steadily at the woman, and said, "I
know quite well who wrapped me up in my bedcover and
brought me down in the sleigh: it was grandfather."</p>

<p>"There was some truth then perhaps in what Peter used
to tell us of Alm-Uncle during the summer, when we thought
he must be wrong," said grandmother; "but who would ever
have believed that such a thing was possible; I did not think
the child would live three weeks up there. What is she like,
Brigitta?"</p>

<p>The latter had so thoroughly examined Heidi on all sides
that she was well able to describe her to her mother.</p>

<p>Heidi meanwhile had not been idle; she had made the
round of the room and looked carefully at everything there
was to be seen. All of a sudden she exclaimed, "Grandmother,
one of your shutters is flapping backwards and forwards:
grandfather would put a nail in and make it all right
in a minute. It will break one of the panes some day; look,
how it keeps on banging!"</p>

<p>"Ah, dear child," said the old woman, "I am not able to
see it, but I can hear that and many other things besides the
shutter. Everything about the place rattles and creaks when
the wind is blowing, and it gets inside through all the cracks
and holes. The house is going to pieces, and in the night,
when the two others are asleep, I often lie awake in fear and
trembling, thinking that the whole place will give way and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>
fall and kill us. And there is not a creature to mend anything
for us, for Peter does not understand such work."</p>

<p>"But why cannot you see, Grandmother, that the shutter
is loose. Look, there it goes again, see, that one there!" And
Heidi pointed to the particular shutter.</p>

<p>"Alas, child, I can see nothing, nothing," said the grandmother
in a voice of lamentation.</p>

<p>"But if I were to go outside and put back the shutter so
that you had more light, then you could see, Grandmother?"</p>

<p>"No, no, not even then, no one can make it light for me
again."</p>

<p>"But if you were to go outside among all the white snow,
then surely you would find it light; just come with me, Grandmother,
and I will show you." Heidi took hold of the old
woman's hand to lead her along, for she was beginning to feel
quite distressed at the thought of her being without light.</p>

<p>"Let me be, dear child; it is always dark for me now;
whether in snow or sun. It will never be light for me again on
earth, never."</p>

<p>At these words Heidi broke into loud crying. In her distress
she kept on sobbing out, "Who can make it light for you
again? Can no one do it? Isn't there any one who can do it?"</p>

<p>The grandmother now tried to comfort the child, but it
was not easy to quiet her. Heidi did not often weep, but when
she did she could not get over her trouble for a long while. At
last the old woman said, "Dear Heidi, you cannot think how
glad I am to hear a kind word when I can no longer see, and
it is such a pleasure to me to listen to you while you talk. So
come and sit beside me and tell me what you do up there, and
how grandfather occupies himself. I knew him very well in
the old days; but for many years now I have heard nothing of
him, except through Peter, who never says much."</p>

<p>This was a new and happy idea to Heidi; she quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>
dried her tears and said in a comforting voice, "Wait, Grandmother,
till I have told grandfather everything, he will make
it light for you again, I am sure, and will do something so that
the house will not fall; he will put everything right for you."</p>

<p>Heidi now began to give a lively description of her life
with the grandfather, and of the days she spent on the
mountain with the goats, and then went on to tell what she
did during the winter, and how her grandfather was able to
make all sorts of things, seats and stools, and mangers where
the hay was put for Little Swan and Little Bear, besides a
new large water-tub for her to bathe in when the summer
came, and a new milk-bowl and spoon.</p>

<p>The grandmother listened with the greatest attention,
only from time to time addressing her daughter, "Do you hear
that, Brigitta? Do you hear what she is saying about Uncle?"</p>

<p>The conversation was suddenly interrupted by a heavy
thump on the door, and in marched Peter, who stood stock-still,
opening his eyes with astonishment, when he caught
sight of Heidi; then his face beamed with smiles as she called
out, "Good-evening, Peter."</p>

<p>"What, is the boy back from school already," exclaimed
the grandmother in surprise. "I have not known an afternoon
to pass so quickly as this one for years. How is the reading
getting on, Peter?"</p>

<p>"As usual," was Peter's answer.</p>

<p>The old woman gave a little sigh, "Ah, well," she said, "I
hoped you would have something different to tell me by this
time, as you are going to be twelve years old this February."</p>

<p>"What was it you hoped he would have to tell you?"
asked Heidi, interested in all the grandmother said.</p>

<p>"I mean that he ought to have learnt to read a bit by
now," continued the grandmother. "Up there on the shelf is
an old prayer-book, with beautiful songs in it which I have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
heard for a long time and cannot now remember to repeat to
myself, and I hoped that Peter would soon learn enough to be
able to read one of them to me sometimes; but he finds it too
difficult."</p>

<p>Heidi now jumped up from her low chair, and holding
out her hand hastily to the grandmother said, "Good-night,
Grandmother, it is getting dark; I must go home at once," and
bidding good-bye to Peter and his mother she went towards
the door. But the grandmother called out in an anxious
voice, "Wait, wait, Heidi, you must not go alone like that,
Peter must go with you. Have you got something warm to
put round your throat?"</p>

<p>"I have not anything to put on," called back Heidi, "but
I am sure I shall not be cold," and with that she ran outside
and went off at such a pace that Peter had difficulty in overtaking
her.</p>

<p>The children had taken but a few steps before they saw
the grandfather coming down to meet them, and in another
minute his long strides had brought him to their side.</p>

<p>"That's right, Heidi; you have kept your word," said the
grandfather, and then wrapping the sack firmly round her he
lifted her in his arms and strode off with her up the mountain.</p>

<p>They had no sooner got inside the hut than Heidi at once
began: "Grandfather, tomorrow we must take the hammer
and the long nails and fasten grandmother's shutter, and
drive in a lot more nails in other places, for her house shakes
and rattles all over."</p>

<p>"We must, must we? who told you that?" asked her
grandfather.</p>


<p>"Nobody told me, but I know it for all that," replied
Heidi, "for everything is giving way, and when the grandmother
cannot sleep, she lies trembling, for she thinks that
every minute the house will fall down on their heads; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>
everything now is dark for grandmother, and she does not
think any one can make it light for her again, but you will be
able to, I am sure, Grandfather. Tomorrow we must go and
help her; we will, won't we, Grandfather?"</p>

<p>The child was clinging to the old man and looking up at
him in trustful confidence. The grandfather looked down at
Heidi for a while without speaking, and then said, "Yes,
Heidi, we will do something to stop the rattling, at least we
can do that; we will go down about it tomorrow."</p>

<p>The child went skipping round the room for joy, crying
out, "We shall go tomorrow! we shall go tomorrow!"</p>

<p>The grandfather kept his promise. On the following
afternoon he brought the sleigh out again, and as on the
previous day, he set Heidi down at the door of the grandmother's
hut and said, "Go in now, and when it grows dark,
come out again." Then he put the sack in the sleigh and went
round the house.</p>

<p>Heidi had hardly opened the door and sprung into the
room when the grandmother called out from her corner, "It's
the child again! here she comes!" Heidi ran to her, and then
quickly drew the little stool close up to the old woman, and
seating herself upon it, began to tell and ask her all kinds of
things. All at once came the sound of heavy blows against the
wall of the hut and grandmother gave such a start of alarm
that she nearly upset the spinning-wheel, and cried in a
trembling voice, "Ah, my God, now it is coming, the house is
going to fall upon us!" But Heidi caught her by the arm, and
said soothingly, "No, no, Grandmother, do not be frightened,
it is only grandfather with his hammer; he is mending up
everything, so that you shan't have such fear and trouble."</p>

<p>"Is it possible! is it really possible! so the dear God has
not forgotten us!" exclaimed the grandmother. "Do you
hear, Brigitta, what that noise is? Did you hear what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>
child says? Go outside, Brigitta, and if it is Alm-Uncle, tell
him he must come inside a moment that I may thank him."</p>

<p>Brigitta went outside and found Alm-Uncle in the act of
fastening some heavy pieces of new wood along the wall. She
stepped up to him and said, "Good-evening, Uncle, mother
and I thank you for doing us such a kind service, and she
would like to tell you herself how grateful she is; I do not
know who else would have done it for us; we shall not forget
your kindness, for I am sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will do," said the old man, interrupting her. "I
know what you think of Alm-Uncle without your telling me.
Go indoors again, I can find out for myself where the mending
is wanted."</p>

<p>Brigitta obeyed on the spot, for Uncle had a way with
him that made few people care to oppose his will. He went on
knocking with his hammer all round the house, and then
mounted the narrow steps to the roof, and hammered away
there, until he had used up all the nails he had brought with
him. Meanwhile it had been growing dark, and he had hardly
come down from the roof and dragged the sleigh out from
behind the goat-shed when Heidi appeared outside. The
grandfather wrapped her up and took her in his arms as he
had done the day before, for although he had to drag the
sleigh up the mountain after him, he feared that if the child
sat in it alone her wrappings would fall off and that she would
be nearly if not quite frozen, so he carried her warm and safe
in his arms.</p>

<p>So the winter went by. After many years of joyless life,
the blind grandmother had at last found something to make
her happy. She listened for the little tripping footstep as
soon as day had come, and when she heard the door open and
knew the child was really there, she would call out, "God be
thanked, she has come again!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span></p>

<p>And Heidi had also grown very fond of the old grandmother,
and when at last she knew for certain that no one
could make it light for her again, she was overcome with sorrow;
but the grandmother told her again that she felt the
darkness much less when Heidi was with her, and so every
fine winter's day the child came traveling down in her sleigh.
The grandfather always took her, never raising any objection,
indeed he always carried the hammer and sundry other things
down in the sleigh with him, and many an afternoon was
spent by him in making the goatherd's cottage sound and
tight. It no longer groaned and rattled the whole night
through, and the grandmother, who for many winters had not
been able to sleep in peace as she did now, said she should
never forget what the Uncle had done for her.</p>

<small>A RAILROAD JOURNEY</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">H<span class="smcap">eidi</span> was now in her eighth year; she had learnt all kinds
of useful things from her grandfather; she knew how to
look after the goats as well as any one, and Little Swan and
Little Bear would follow her like two faithful dogs, and give
a loud bleat of pleasure when they heard her voice. Twice
during the course of this last winter Peter had brought up a
message from the schoolmaster at Doerfli, who sent word to
Alm-Uncle that he ought to send Heidi to school, as she was
over the usual age, and ought indeed to have gone the winter
before. Uncle had sent word back each time that the schoolmaster
would find him at home if he had anything he wished
to say to him, but that he did not intend to send Heidi to
school.</p>

<p>As Heidi was running about one sunny March morning,
and had just jumped over the water-trough for the tenth time
at least, she nearly fell backwards into it with fright, for there
in front of her stood an old gentleman dressed in black. When
he saw how startled she was, he said in a kind voice, "Don't
be afraid of me, for I am very fond of children. Shake hands!
You must be the Heidi I have heard of; where is your grandfather?"</p>

<p>"He is sitting by the table, making round wooden
spoons," Heidi informed him, as she opened the door.</p>

<p>It was the old village pastor from Doerfli who had been
a neighbor of Uncle's when he lived down there. He stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>
inside the hut, and going up to the old man, who was bending
over his work, said, "Good-morning, neighbor."</p>

<p>The grandfather looked up in surprise, and then rising
said, "Good-morning" in return. He pushed his chair towards
the visitor as he continued, "If you do not mind a
wooden seat there is one for you."</p>

<p>The pastor sat down. "It is a long time since I have seen
you, neighbor," he said. "I think you know already what it
is that has brought me here," and as he spoke he looked towards
the child who was standing at the door.</p>

<p>"Heidi, go off to the goats," said her grandfather. "You
can take them a little salt and stay with them till I come."</p>

<p>Heidi vanished on the spot.</p>

<p>"The child ought to have been at school a year ago, and
most certainly this last winter," said the pastor. "The schoolmaster
sent you word about it, but you gave him no answer.
What are you thinking of doing with the child, neighbor?"</p>

<p>"I am thinking of not sending her to school," was the
answer.</p>

<p>"How are you going to let her grow up then?"</p>

<p>"I am going to let her grow up and be happy among the
goats and birds; with them she is safe, and will learn nothing
evil."</p>

<p>"But the child is not a goat or a bird, she is a human
being. It is time she began her lessons. This is the last
winter she must be allowed to run wild; next winter she must
come regularly to school every day."</p>

<p>"She will do no such thing," said the old man with calm
determination.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you intend to stick obstinately to
your decision?" said the pastor, growing somewhat angry.
"You have been about the world, and I should have given you
credit for more sense, neighbor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed," replied the old man, "could you expect me to
send a young child down the mountain on ice-cold mornings
through storm and snow, and let her return at night when the
wind is raging? Have you forgotten the child's mother,
Adelaide? She was a sleep-walker, and had fits. Might not
the child be attacked in the same way if obliged to over-exert
herself? And you think you can come and force me to send
her? I will go before all the courts of justice in the country,
and then we shall see who will force me to do it!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right, neighbor," said the pastor in a
friendly tone of voice. "If it is impossible to send the child to
school from here, come down into Doerfli and live again among
your fellow-men. What sort of a life is this you lead, alone,
and with bitter thoughts towards God and man."</p>

<p>"No, pastor, as to going down to Doerfli to live, that is
far from my thoughts; the people despise me and I them; it
is therefore best for all of us that we live apart."</p>

<p>The visitor had risen and stood holding out his hand to
the old man as he added with renewed earnestness, "I will
wager, that next winter you will be down among us again, and
we shall be good neighbors as of old. Promise me that you
will come and live with us again and become reconciled to God
and man."</p>

<p>Alm-Uncle gave the pastor his hand and answered him
calmly and firmly, "You mean well by me, I know, but I will
not send the child to school nor come and live among you."</p>

<p>"Then God help you!" said the pastor, as he left the hut
and went down the mountain.</p>

<p>Alm-Uncle was out of humor. When Heidi said as usual
that afternoon, "Can we go down to grandmother now?" he
answered, "Not today." He did not speak again the whole
day, and the following morning when Heidi again asked the
same question, he replied, "We will see." But before the dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>
bowls bad been cleared away another visitor arrived, and
this time it was Dete. She wore a fine feathered hat and a
long trailing dress which swept the floor.</p>

<p>The grandfather looked her up and down without uttering
a word. But Dete was prepared with an exceedingly
amiable speech and began at once to praise the looks of the
child. She should hardly have known her again, and it was
evident that Heidi had been happy and well-cared-for with
her grandfather. But she had just heard of something that
would be a lucky chance for her. Some wealthy people in
Frankfurt wanted a companion for their only daughter who
was an invalid. Heidi was just the sort of child they were
looking for, simple-minded and unspoiled, and after Dete
had given them a description of Heidi, they had agreed to
take her. And no one could tell what good fortune there
might not be in store for her, for if these rich people should
take a fancy to Heidi&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you nearly finished what you had to say?" broke
in Alm-Uncle, who had allowed her to talk on uninterruptedly
so far.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" exclaimed Dete, throwing up her head in disgust,
"one would think I had been talking to you about the
most ordinary matter; why, there is not one person in all
Praettigau who would not thank God if I were to bring them
such a piece of news as I am bringing you."</p>

<p>"You may take your news to anybody you like, I will
have nothing to do with it."</p>

<p>Dete leaped up from her seat like a rocket and cried, "If
that is all you have to say about it, why, then I will give you a
bit of my mind. The child is now eight years old and knows
nothing, and you will not let her learn. You will not send her
to church or school, as I was told down in Doerfli, and she is
my own sister's child. I am responsible for what happens to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>
her, and this is a good opening for her. I have everybody in
Doerfli on my side; there is not one person there who will not
take my part against you; and I advise you to think well before
bringing it into court, if that is your intention; there are
certain things which might be brought up against you that
you would not care to hear, for when one has to do with lawcourts
there is a great deal raked up that had been forgotten."</p>

<p>"Be silent!" thundered the Uncle, and his eyes flashed
with anger. "Go and be done with you! and never let me see
you again with your hat and feather." And with that he
strode out of the hut.</p>

<p>"You have made grandfather angry," said Heidi, and
her dark eyes had anything but a friendly expression in them
as she looked at Dete.</p>

<p>"He will soon be all right again; come now," said Dete
hurriedly, "and show me where your clothes are."</p>

<p>"I am not coming," said Heidi.</p>

<p>"Come, come, you will have all sorts of good things that
you never dreamed of." Then she went to the cupboard and
taking out Heidi's things rolled them up in a bundle. "Come
along now, there's your hat; it is very shabby but will do for
the present; put it on and let us make haste off."</p>

<p>"I am not coming," repeated Heidi.</p>

<p>"Don't be stupid and obstinate, like a goat; I suppose
it's from the goats you have learnt to be so. Listen to me:
you saw your grandfather was angry and heard what he said,
that he did not wish to ever see us again; he wants you to go
away with me and you must not make him angrier still. You
can't think how nice it is at Frankfurt, and if you do not like
it you can come back again; your grandfather will be in a good
humor by that time."</p>

<p>"Can I return at once and be back home again here this
evening?" asked Heidi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span></p>

<p>"What are you talking about, come along now! I tell you
that you can come back here when you like. Today we shall
go as far as Mayenfeld, and early tomorrow we shall start in
the train; it will bring you home again in no time when you
wish it, for it goes as fast as the wind."</p>

<p>They started down the mountain and as they neared the
grandmother's hut they met Peter coming round the corner
carrying an immense bundle of long, thick hazel sticks on his
shoulders. He stood still and stared at the two approaching
figures; as they came up to him, he exclaimed, "Where are
you going, Heidi?"</p>

<p>"I am only just going over to Frankfurt for a little visit
with Dete," she replied; "but I must first run in to grandmother,
she will be expecting me."</p>

<p>"No, no, you must not stop to talk; it is already too late,"
said Dete, holding Heidi, who was struggling to get away.
"You can go in when you come back," and she pulled the child
on with her. Peter ran into the hut and banged against the
table with his bundle of sticks with such violence that everything
in the room shook, and his grandmother leaped up with
a cry of alarm from her spinning-wheel.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? what is the matter?" cried the
frightened old woman.</p>

<p>"She is taking Heidi away," explained Peter.</p>

<p>"Who? who? where to, Peter, where to?" asked the
grandmother, growing still more agitated; but even as she
spoke she guessed what had happened, for Brigitta had told
her shortly before that she had seen Dete going up to Alm-Uncle.
The old woman opened the window and called out beseechingly,
"Dete, Dete, do not take the child away from us!
do not take her away!"</p>

<p>The two who were hastening down the mountain heard
her voice, and Dete evidently caught the words, for she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>
grasped Heidi's hand more firmly. Heidi struggled to get
free, crying, "Grandmother is calling, I must go to her."</p>

<p>But Dete had no intention of letting the child go, and
quieted her as best she could by promising that she could take
something nice back to grandmother. This was a new idea to
Heidi, and it pleased her so much that Dete had no longer any
difficulty in getting her along.</p>

<p>"What could I take back to her?" Heidi asked.</p>

<p>"A soft roll of white bread; she would enjoy that, for now
she is old she can hardly eat the hard, black bread," answered
Dete.</p>

<p>"Yes, she always gives it back to Peter, telling him it is
too hard," affirmed Heidi. "Do let us make haste, for then
perhaps we can get back soon from Frankfurt, and I shall be
able to give her the white bread today." And Heidi started
off running so fast that Dete with the bundle under her arm
could scarcely keep up with her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From that day forward Alm-Uncle looked fiercer and
more forbidding than ever when he came down and passed
through Doerfli. He spoke to no one, and looked such an ogre
as he came along with his pack of cheeses on his back, his immense
stick in his hand, and his thick, frowning eyebrows,
that the women would call to their little ones, "Take care! get
out of Alm-Uncle's way or he may hurt you!"</p>

<p>The old man took no notice of anybody as he strode
through the village on his way to the valley below, where he
sold his cheeses and bought what bread and meat he wanted
for himself. After he had passed, the villagers all crowded
together looking after him. They agreed that it was a great
mercy the child had got away from him. Only the blind
grandmother would have nothing to say against him, and told
those who came to bring her work, how kind and thoughtful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>
he had been with the child, how good to her and her daughter,
and how many afternoons he had spent mending the house.
All this was repeated down in Doerfli; but most of the people
who heard it said that grandmother was too old to understand,
and very likely had not heard rightly what was said;
as she was blind, probably she was also deaf.</p>

<small>CLARA, THE PATIENT LITTLE INVALID</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">n</span> her home at Frankfurt, Clara, the little daughter of Mr.
Sesemann, was lying on the invalid couch on which she
spent her whole day, being wheeled in it from room to room.</p>

<p>Her little face was thin and pale, and at this moment her
two soft blue eyes were fixed on the clock, which seemed to her
to go very slowly this day, and with a slight accent of impatience,
which was very rare with her, she asked, "Isn't it
time yet, Miss Rottermeyer?"</p>

<p>This lady was sitting very upright at a small work-table,
busy with her embroidery. She wore a dome-shaped head
piece which made her look very solemn and dignified. For
many years past, since Clara's mother had died, the housekeeping
and the superintendence of the servants had been entrusted
to Miss Rottermeyer. The father who was often away
from home, left her in sole charge, with the condition only that
his little daughter should have a voice in all matters, and that
nothing should be done against her wish.</p>

<p>As Clara was putting her impatient question for the second
time, Dete and Heidi arrived at the front door.</p>

<p>Tinette, the maid in dainty cap and apron, ushered
them upstairs into the library. Dete remained standing politely
near the door, still holding Heidi tightly by the hand,
for she did not know what the child might take it into her
head to do amid these new surroundings.</p>

<p>Miss Rottermeyer rose slowly and went up to the little
new companion for the daughter of the house, to see what she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>
was like. She did not seem very pleased with her appearance.
Heidi was dressed in her plain little woolen frock, and her hat
was an old straw one bent out of shape. The child looked innocently
out from beneath it, gazing with unconcealed astonishment
at the lady's towering head dress.</p>


<p>"What is your name?" asked Miss Rottermeyer, after examining
the child for some minutes, while Heidi in return
kept her eyes steadily fixed upon the lady.</p>

<p>"Heidi," she answered in a clear, ringing voice.</p>

<p>"What? what? that's no Christian name for a child; you
were not christened that. What name did they give you when
you were baptized?" continued Miss Rottermeyer.</p>

<p>"I do not remember," replied Heidi.</p>

<p>"What a way to answer!" said the lady, shaking her
head. "Dete, is the child a simpleton or only saucy?"</p>

<p>"If the lady will allow me, I will speak for the child, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>
she is very unaccustomed to strangers," said Dete, who had
given Heidi a silent poke for making such an unsuitable
answer. "She is certainly not stupid nor yet saucy, she
speaks exactly as she thinks. This is the first time she has
ever been in a gentleman's house and she does not know good
manners; but she is very willing to learn. She was christened
Adelaide, after her mother, my sister, who is now dead."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a name that one can pronounce," remarked
Miss Rottermeyer. "But I must tell you, Dete, that
I am astonished to see so young a child. I told you that I
wanted a companion of the same age as the young lady of the
house, one who could share her lessons, and all her other occupations.
Miss Clara is now over twelve; what age is this
child?"</p>

<p>"If the lady will allow me," began Dete again, in her
usual fluent manner, "I myself had lost count of her exact
age; she is certainly a little younger, but not much; I cannot
say precisely, but I think she is ten, or thereabouts."</p>

<p>"Grandfather told me I was eight," put in Heidi. Dete
gave her another poke, but as the child had not the least idea
why she did so she was not at all confused.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;only eight!" cried Miss Rottermeyer angrily.
"Four years too young! Of what use is such a child! And
what have you learnt? What books did you have to learn
from?"</p>

<p>"None," said Heidi.</p>

<p>"How? what? How then did you learn to read?" continued
the lady.</p>

<p>"I have never learnt to read, or Peter either," Heidi informed
her.</p>

<p>"Mercy upon us! you do not know how to read! is it
really so?" exclaimed Miss Rottermeyer, greatly horrified.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>
"Is it possible&mdash;not able to read? What have you learnt
then?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Heidi with unflinching truthfulness.</p>

<p>"Young woman," said the lady to Dete, "this is not at all
the sort of companion we want. How could you think of
bringing me a child like this?"</p>

<p>But Dete was not to be put down so easily, and answered
warmly, "If you will allow me, the child is exactly what I
thought you required; she is unlike all other children, and
I thought this child seemed as if made for the place. But I
must go now, for my mistress will be waiting for me; if you
will permit I will come again soon and see how she is getting
on." And with a bow Dete quickly left the room and ran
downstairs. Miss Rottermeyer stood for a moment taken
aback and then ran after Dete. But she had disappeared out
the front door.</p>

<p>Heidi remained where she had been standing since she
first came in. Clara had looked on during the interview without
speaking; now she beckoned to Heidi and said, "Come
here!"</p>

<p>Heidi went up to her.</p>

<p>"Would you rather be called Heidi or Adelaide?" asked
Clara.</p>

<p>"I am never called anything but Heidi," was the child's
prompt answer.</p>

<p>"Then I shall always call you by that name," said Clara,
"it suits you. I have never heard it before, but neither have I
ever seen a child like you before. Have you always had that
short curly hair?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so," said Heidi.</p>

<p>"Are you pleased to come to Frankfurt?" went on Clara.</p>

<p>"No, but I shall go home again tomorrow and take grandmother
a white loaf," explained Heidi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you are a funny child!" exclaimed Clara. "Don't
you know you were sent for to come here and stay with me
and share my lessons? They are dreadfully dull, and I think
the morning will never pass away. My tutor comes every
morning at about ten o'clock, and then we go on with lessons
till two, and it does seem such a long time. Sometimes he
takes up the book and holds it close up to his face, as if he
were very short-sighted, but I know it's only because he wants
to gape, and Miss Rottermeyer takes her large handkerchief
out also now and then and covers her face with it, as if she was
moved by what we had been reading, but that is only because
she is longing to gape too. And I myself often want to gape,
but I dare not, for if Miss Rottermeyer sees me gaping she
runs off at once and fetches the cod-liver oil and says I must
have a dose, as I am getting weak again, and the cod-liver oil
is horrible. But now it will be much more amusing, for I shall
be able to lie back and listen while you learn to read."</p>

<p>Heidi shook her head doubtfully when she heard of learning
to read.</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, Heidi, of course you must learn to read,
everybody must, and my tutor is very kind, and never cross,
and he will explain everything to you. But mind, when he explains
anything to you, you won't be able to understand; but
don't ask any questions, or else he will go on explaining and
you will understand less than ever. Later, when you have
learnt more and know about things yourself, then you will
begin to understand what he meant."</p>

<p>Miss Rottermeyer now came back into the room; she had
not been able to overtake Dete, and was evidently very much
put out. She walked backwards and forwards in a state of
agitation between the study and the dining-room, and began
scolding the butler. "Make haste, Sebastian, or we shall get
no dinner today at all," she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span></p>

<p>Then hurrying out, she called to Tinette to see that the
bed-room was prepared for the little girl who had just arrived.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sebastian had flung open the folding doors
leading into the dining-room with rather more noise than he
need, for he was feeling cross, although he did not dare answer
back when Miss Rottermeyer spoke to him; he went up to
Clara's chair to wheel her into the next room. Heidi stood
staring at him. Seeing her eyes fixed upon him, he suddenly
growled out, "Well, what is there in me to stare at like that?"
which he would certainly not have done if he had been aware
that Miss Rottermeyer was just then entering the room.
"You look so like Peter," answered Heidi. The housekeeper
clasped her hands in horror. "Is it possible!" she stammered
half-aloud, "she is now addressing the servant as if he were a
friend! I never could have imagined such a child!"</p>

<p>Sebastian wheeled the couch into the dining-room and
helped Clara on to her chair. Miss Rottermeyer took the seat
beside her and made a sign to Heidi to take the one opposite.
Beside Heidi's plate lay a nice white roll, and her eyes lighted
up with pleasure as she saw it. When Sebastian came up to
her side and handed her the dish of fish, she looked at the
roll and asked, "Can I have it?" Sebastian nodded, and Heidi
immediately seized the roll and put it in her pocket. Sebastian
still remained standing beside Heidi; it was not his duty to
speak, nor to move away until she had helped herself. Heidi
looked wonderingly at him for a minute or two, and then said,
"Am I to eat some of that too?" Sebastian nodded again.
"Give me some then," she said, looking calmly at her plate.</p>

<p>"I see I shall have to teach you the first rules of behavior,"
said the housekeeper with a sigh. "You must not
speak to Sebastian at table, or at any other time, unless you
have an order to give him, and then you are not to address<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
him as if he was some one belonging to you. Never let me
hear you speak to him in that way again! It is the same with
Tinette, and for myself you are to address me as you hear
others doing. Clara must herself decide what you are to call
her."</p>

<p>"Why, Clara, of course," put in the latter. Then followed
a long list of rules as to general behavior, during the
course of which Heidi's eyes gradually closed, for she had
been up before five o'clock that morning and had had a long
journey. She leaned back in her chair and fell fast asleep.
Miss Rottermeyer having at last come to the end of her lecture
said, "Now remember what I have said, Adelaide! Have you
understood it all?"</p>

<p>"Heidi has been asleep for ever so long," said Clara, her
face rippling all over with amusement, for she had not had
such an entertaining dinner for a long time.</p>

<p>"It is really insupportable what one has to go through
with this child," exclaimed Miss Rottermeyer, in great indignation,
and she rang the bell so violently that Tinette and
Sebastian both came running in; but no noise was sufficient
to wake Heidi, and it was with difficulty that they roused her
sufficiently to get her to her bed-room.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="ChVII." id="ChVII."></a>CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>THE UNFRIENDLY HOUSEKEEPER</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">W<span class="smcap">hen</span> Heidi opened her eyes on her first morning in
Frankfurt she could not think where she was. Then
she rubbed them and looked about her. She was sitting up
in a high white bed, in a large, wide room with very long white
curtains; near the window stood two chairs covered with large
flowered material and then came a sofa with the same flowers,
in front of which was a round table; in the corner was a washstand,
with things upon it that Heidi had never seen in her
life before. But now all at once she remembered that she was
in Frankfurt. She jumped out of bed and dressed herself;
then she ran first to one window and then another; she wanted
to see the sky and country outside; she felt like a bird in a
cage behind those great curtains. But they were too heavy
for her to put aside, so she crept underneath them to get to
the window. But she could see nothing but walls and
windows. She felt quite frightened and ran backwards and
forwards, trying to open first one and then the other of the
windows, for she felt that somewhere outside there must be
the green grass, and the last unmelted snows on the mountain
slopes. But the windows remained immovable, try what
Heidi would to open them. Suddenly there was a knock on
the door, and immediately after Tinette put her head inside
and said, "Breakfast is ready." Heidi had no idea what an
invitation so worded meant, and Tinette's face did not encourage
any questioning on Heidi's part. Heidi was sharp
enough to read its expression and acted accordingly. So she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>
drew a little stool out from under the table, put it in the corner
and sat down upon it, and there silently awaited what would
happen next. Shortly after, Miss Rottermeyer appeared.
She seemed very much put out, and called to Heidi, "What is
the matter with you, Adelaide? Don't you understand what
breakfast is? Come along at once!"</p>

<p>Heidi had no difficulty in understanding now and followed
at once. Clara gave her a kindly greeting, her face looking
considerably more cheerful than usual, for she looked forward
to all kinds of new things happening again that day. Breakfast
passed off quietly; Heidi ate her bread and butter in a
perfectly correct manner, and when the meal was over and
Clara wheeled back into the study, Miss Rottermeyer told her
to follow and remain with Clara until the tutor should arrive
and lessons begin.</p>

<p>As soon as the children were alone again, Heidi asked,
"How can one see out from here, and look right down on to the
ground?"</p>

<p>"You must open the window and look out," replied Clara
amused.</p>

<p>"But the windows won't open," responded Heidi sadly.</p>

<p>"Yes, they will," Clara assured her. "You cannot open
them, nor I either, but when you see Sebastian you can ask
him to open one."</p>

<p>It was a great relief to Heidi to know that the windows
could be opened and that one could look out. Clara now began
to ask her questions about her home, and Heidi was delighted
to tell her all about the mountain and the goats, and
the flowery meadows.</p>

<p>Meanwhile her tutor had arrived; Miss Rottermeyer,
however, did not bring him straight into the study but drew
him first aside into the dining-room, where she poured forth
her troubles. It appeared that she had written some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>
back to Mr. Sesemann to tell him that his daughter very much
desired to have a companion. Miss Rottermeyer had wished
for this arrangement on her own behalf, as it would relieve
her from having always to entertain the sick girl. The father
had answered that he was quite willing to let his daughter
have a companion, provided she was treated in every way like
his own child. But now she went on to explain how dreadfully
she had been taken in about the child, and related all the unimaginable
things of which she had already been guilty, so
that not only would he have to begin with teaching her the
A B C, but would have to start with the most rudimentary instruction
as regarded everything to do with daily life. She
could see only one way out of this disastrous state of affairs,
and that was for the tutor to declare that it was impossible
for the two to learn together without detriment to Clara, who
was so far ahead of the other; that would be a good excuse for
getting rid of the child. But she dared not send her home
without Mr. Sesemann's order, since he was aware that by
this time the companion had arrived. The tutor was a cautious
man and said that if the little girl was backward in some
things she was probably advanced in others, and a little regular
teaching would soon set the balance right. When Miss
Rottermeyer saw that he was not ready to support her, and
evidently quite ready to undertake teaching the alphabet, she
opened the study door, which she quickly shut again as soon
as he had gone through remaining on the other side herself,
for she had a perfect horror of the A B C. She walked up and
down the dining-room, thinking over in her own mind how
the servants were to be told to address Adelaide. The father
had written that she was to be treated exactly like his own
daughter, and this would especially refer, she imagined, to the
servants. She was not allowed, however, a very long interval
of time for consideration, for suddenly the sound of a frightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>
crash was heard in the study, followed by frantic cries for
Sebastian. She rushed into the room. There on the floor lay
in a confused heap, books, exercise-books and inkstand, with
the table-cloth on the top, while from beneath them a dark
stream of ink was flowing all across the floor. Heidi had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Here's a state of things!" exclaimed Miss Rottermeyer.
"Table-cloth, books, work-basket, everything lying in the ink!
It was that unfortunate child, I suppose!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Heidi did it," explained Clara, "but quite by accident;
she must on no account be punished; she jumped up in
such violent haste to get away that she dragged the table-cloth
along with her, and so everything went over. There were a
number of vehicles passing, that is why she rushed off like
that; perhaps she has never seen a carriage."</p>

<p>"Is it not as I said? She has not the smallest notion
about anything! But where is the child who has caused all
this trouble? Surely she has not run away! What would Mr.
Sesemann say to me?" She ran out of the room and down
the stairs. There, at the bottom, standing in the open doorway,
was Heidi, looking in amazement up and down the street.</p>

<p>"What are you doing? What are you thinking of to run
away like that?" called Miss Rottermeyer.</p>

<p>"I heard the sound of the fir trees, but I cannot see where
they are, and now I cannot hear them any more," answered
Heidi, looking disappointedly in the direction whence the
noise of the passing carriages had reached her, and which to
Heidi had seemed like the blowing of the south wind in the
trees, so that in great joy of heart she had rushed out to look
at them.</p>

<p>"Fir trees! do you suppose we are in the woods? What
ridiculous ideas are these? Come upstairs and see the mischief
you have done!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span></p>

<p>Heidi followed Miss Rottermeyer upstairs; she was quite
astonished to see the disaster she had caused, for in her joy
and haste to get to the fir trees she had been unaware of having
dragged everything after her.</p>

<p>"I excuse you doing this as it is the first time, but do not
let me hear of you doing it a second time," said Miss Rottermeyer
pointing to the floor. "During your lesson time you
are to sit still and attend. If you cannot do this I shall have
to tie you to your chair. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Heidi, "but I will certainly not move
again," for now she understood that it was a rule to sit still
while she was being taught.</p>

<p>When Clara had been placed on her couch after dinner,
and the housekeeper had retired to her room, Heidi waited
for Sebastian who was coming up from the kitchen with a tray
of silver tea-things, which he had to put away in the dining-room
cupboard. As he reached the top stair Heidi went up to
him and addressed him in the formal manner she had been
ordered to use by Miss Rottermeyer.</p>

<p>Sebastian looked surprised and said somewhat curtly,
"What is it you want, miss?"</p>

<p>"How can a window be opened?"</p>

<p>"Why, like that!" and Sebastian flung up one of the
large windows.</p>

<p>Heidi ran to it, but she was not tall enough to see out, for
her head only reached the sill.</p>

<p>"There, now miss can look out and see what is going on
below," said Sebastian as he brought her a high wooden stool
to stand on.</p>

<p>Heidi climbed up, and at last, as she thought, was going
to see what she had been longing for. But she drew back her
head with a look of great disappointment on her face.</p>


<p>"Why, there is nothing outside but the stony streets,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>
she said mournfully; "but if I went right round to the other
side of the house what should I see there, Sebastian?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but what you see here," he told her.</p>

<p>"Then where can I go to see right away over the whole
valley?"</p>

<p>"You would have to climb to the top of a high tower, a
church tower, like that one over there with the gold ball above
it."</p>

<p>Heidi got down quickly from her stool, ran to the door,
down the steps and out into the street. She passed a great
many people, but they all seemed in such a hurry that Heidi
thought they had not time to tell her which way to go. Then
suddenly at one of the street corners she saw a boy carrying a
hand-organ on his back and a funny-looking animal on his
arm. Heidi ran up to him and said, "Where is the tower with
the gold ball on the top?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Do you know any other church with a high tower?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know one."</p>

<p>"Come then and show it me."</p>

<p>"Show me first what you will give me," and the boy held
out his hand as he spoke. Heidi searched about in her pocket
and presently drew out a card on which was painted a garland
of beautiful red roses; she looked at it first for a moment or
two, for she felt rather sorry to part with it; Clara had only
that morning made her a present of it&mdash;but then, to look down
into the valley and see all the lovely green slopes! "There,"
said Heidi holding out the card, "would you like to have
that?"</p>

<p>The boy drew back his hand and shook his head.</p>

<p>"What would you like then?" asked Heidi, not sorry to
put the card back in her pocket.</p>

<p>"Money."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span></p>

<p>"I have none, but Clara has; I am sure she will give me
some; how much do you want?"</p>

<p>"Five cents."</p>

<p>"Come along then."</p>

<p>They started off together along the street, and on the
way Heidi asked her companion what he was carrying on his
back; it was a hand-organ, he told her, which played beautiful
music when he turned the handle. All at once they found
themselves in front of an old church with a high tower; the
boy said, "There it is."</p>

<p>Heidi caught sight of a bell in the wall which she now
pulled with all her might. "If I go up to the tower you must
wait here, for I do not know the way back, and you will have
to show me."</p>

<p>"What will you give me then for that?"</p>

<p>"Another five cents."</p>

<p>They heard the key turning inside, and then some one
pulled open the heavy, creaking door; an old man came out
and at first looked with surprise and then in anger at the
children, as he began scolding them: "What do you mean by
ringing me down like this? Can't you read what is written
over the bell, 'For those who wish to go up the tower'?"</p>

<p>"But I do want to go up the tower," said Heidi.</p>

<p>"What do you want up there?" said the old man. "Has
somebody sent you?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Heidi, "I only wanted to go up and look
down on the valley."</p>

<p>"Get along home with you and don't try this trick again,
or you may not come off so easily a second time," and with
that he turned and was about to shut the door. But Heidi
took hold of his coat and said beseechingly, "Let me go up,
just once."</p>

<p>He looked round, and his mood changed as he saw her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
pleading eyes; he took hold of her hand and said kindly,
"Well, if you really wish it so much, I will take you."</p>

<p>The boy sat down on the church steps to show that he was
content to wait where he was.</p>

<p>When they had climbed to the top of the tower, the old
man lifted Heidi up that she might look out of the open
window.</p>

<p>She saw beneath her a sea of roofs, towers, and chimney-pots;
she quickly drew back her head and said in a sad, disappointed
voice, "It is not at all what I thought."</p>

<p>"You see now, a child like you does not understand anything
about a view! Come along down and don't go ringing
at my bell again!"</p>

<p>On the way down they passed the tower-keeper's room.
At the far end of this was a large basket, in front of which
sat a big grey cat.</p>

<p>Heidi went up to the basket and broke out into expressions
of delight.</p>

<p>"Oh, the sweet little things! the darling kittens," she
kept on saying, as she jumped from side to side of the basket
so as not to lose any of the droll gambols of the seven or eight
little kittens that were scrambling and rolling and falling over
one another.</p>

<p>"Would you like to have one?" said the old man, who enjoyed
watching the child's pleasure.</p>

<p>"For myself, to keep?" said Heidi excitedly, who could
hardly believe such happiness was to be hers.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, more than one if you like&mdash;in short, you
can take away the whole lot if you have room for them," for
the old man was only too glad to think he could get rid of his
kittens without more trouble.</p>

<p>"But how can I take them with me?" asked Heidi, and
was going quickly to see how many she could carry away in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>
her hands, when the old cat sprang at her so fiercely that she
shrank back in fear.</p>

<p>"I will take them for you, if you tell me where," said the
old man, stroking the cat to quiet her.</p>

<p>"To Mr. Sesemann's, the big house where there is a gold
dog's head on the door, with a ring in its mouth," explained
Heidi.</p>

<p>The old man had had charge of the tower for many a
long year and knew every house far and near.</p>

<p>"I know the house," he said, "but when shall I bring
them, and who shall I ask for&mdash;you are not one of the family,
I am sure."</p>

<p>"No, but Clara will be so delighted when I take her the
kittens."</p>

<p>"If I could just take one or two away with me! one for
myself and one for Clara, may I?"</p>

<p>"Well, wait a moment," said the man, and he drew the
cat cautiously away into his room, and leaving her by a bowl
of milk came out again and shut the door. "Now take two
of them."</p>

<p>Heidi's eyes shone with delight. She picked up a white
kitten and another striped white and yellow, and put one in
the right, the other in the left pocket. Then she went downstairs.
The boy was still sitting outside on the steps.</p>

<p>In a very short time they had reached the door with the
large dog's head for a knocker. Heidi rang the bell. Sebastian
opened it quickly, and when he saw it was Heidi, "Make
haste! make haste," he cried in a hurried voice.</p>

<p>Heidi sprang hastily in and Sebastian shut the door after
her, leaving the boy, whom he had not noticed, standing in
wonder on the steps.</p>

<p>"Make haste, little miss," said Sebastian again; "go
straight into the dining-room, they are already at table; Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>
Rottermeyer looks like a loaded cannon. What could make
the little miss run off like that?"</p>

<p>Heidi walked into the room. The housekeeper did not
look up, Clara did not speak; there was an uncomfortable
silence. Sebastian pushed her chair up for her, and when she
was seated Miss Rottermeyer said sternly: "Adelaide, you
have behaved in a most unmannerly way by running out of the
house as you did, without asking permission, without any one
knowing a word about it; and then to go wandering about till
this hour; I never heard of such behavior before."</p>

<p>"Miau!" came the answer back.</p>

<p>This was too much for the lady's temper; with raised
voice she exclaimed, "You dare, Adelaide, after your bad behavior,
to answer me as if it were a joke?"</p>

<p>"I did not&mdash;" began Heidi&mdash;"Miau! miau!"</p>

<p>"That will do," Miss Rottermeyer tried to say, but her
voice was almost stifled with anger. "Get up and leave the
room."</p>

<p>Heidi stood up frightened, and again made an attempt to
explain. "I really did not&mdash;" "Miau! miau! miau!"</p>

<p>"But, Heidi," now put in Clara, "when you see that it
makes Miss Rottermeyer angry, why do you keep on saying
miau?"</p>

<p>"It isn't I, it's the kittens," Heidi was at last given time
to say.</p>

<p>"How! what! kittens!" shrieked Miss Rottermeyer.
"Sebastian! Tinette! Find the horrid little things! take them
away!" And she rose and fled into the study and locked the
door.</p>

<p>When Sebastian entered the dining-room, Clara had the
kittens on her lap, and Heidi was kneeling beside her, both
laughing and playing with the tiny, graceful little animals.</p>

<p>"Sebastian," exclaimed Clara as he came in, "you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>
help us; you must find a bed for the kittens where Miss Rottermeyer
will not spy them out, for she is so afraid of them
that she will send them away at once; but we want to keep
them, and have them out whenever we are alone. Where can
you put them?"</p>

<p>"I will see to that," answered Sebastian willingly. "I
will make a bed in a basket and put it in some place where
the lady is not likely to go; you leave it to me." He set about
the work at once, sniggling to himself the while, for he
guessed there would be a further rumpus about this some day,
and Sebastian was not without a certain pleasure in the
thought of Miss Rottermeyer being a little disturbed.</p>

<p>After some time had elapsed, Miss Rottermeyer opened
the door a crack and called through, "Have you taken those
dreadful little animals away, Sebastian?"</p>

<p>He assured her twice that he had done so; and quickly
and quietly catching up the kittens from Clara's lap, disappeared
with them.</p>

<p>Miss Rottermeyer retired without speaking, Clara and
Heidi following, happy in their minds at knowing that the
kittens were lying in a comfortable bed.</p>

<small>SURPRISES FOR THE CHILDREN</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> tutor had just been shown into the study on the following
morning when there came a very loud ring at the
bell. Sebastian opened the door and there stood a ragged little
boy carrying a hand-organ on his back.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this?" said Sebastian angrily.
"I'll teach you to ring bells like that! What do you want
here?"</p>

<p>"I want to see Clara," the boy answered.</p>

<p>"You good-for-nothing little rascal, can't you be polite
enough to say 'Miss Clara.' What do you want with her?"
continued Sebastian roughly.</p>

<p>"She owes me ten cents," explained the boy.</p>

<p>"You must be out of your mind! And how do you know
that any young lady of that name lives here?"</p>

<p>"She owes me five for showing her the way there, and
five for showing her the way back."</p>

<p>"The young lady never goes out, cannot even walk; be off
and get back to where you came from, before I have to help
you along."</p>

<p>But the boy was not to be frightened away, and said in a
determined voice, "But I saw her in the street, and can describe
her to you; she has short, curly black hair, and black
eyes, and wears a brown dress, and does not talk quite like
we do."</p>

<p>"Oho!" thought Sebastian, laughing to himself, "the little
miss has evidently been up to more mischief." Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
drawing the boy inside he said aloud, "I understand now,
come with me and wait outside the door till I tell you to go in.
Be sure you begin playing your organ the instant you get inside
the room; the lady is very fond of music."</p>

<p>Sebastian knocked at the study door, and a voice said,
"Come in."</p>

<p>"There is a boy outside who says he must speak to Miss
Clara herself," Sebastian announced.</p>

<p>Clara was delighted at such an extraordinary and unexpected
message.</p>

<p>"Let him come in at once," replied Clara.</p>

<p>The boy was already inside the room, and according to
Sebastian's directions immediately began to play his organ.
Miss Rottermeyer hearing the music rushed into the room and
saw the ragged boy turning away at his organ in the most
energetic manner.</p>

<p>"Leave off! leave off at once!" she screamed. But her
voice was drowned by the music. She was making a dash for
the boy, when she saw something on the ground crawling towards
her feet&mdash;a dreadful dark object&mdash;a tortoise. At this
sight she jumped higher than she had for many long years before,
shrieking with all her might, "Sebastian! Sebastian!"</p>

<p>"Take them all out, boy and animal! Get them away at
once!" she commanded him.</p>

<p>Sebastian pulled the boy away, the latter having quickly
caught up his tortoise, and when he had got him outside he put
something into his hand. "There is the ten cents from Miss
Clara, and another ten cents for the music. You did it all quite
right!" and with that he shut the front door upon him.</p>

<p>Quietness reigned again in the study, and lessons began
once more; Miss Rottermeyer now stayed in the study in order
to prevent any further dreadful goings-on.</p>


<p>But soon another knock came to the door, and Sebastian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>
again stepped in, this time to say that someone had brought a
large basket with orders that it was to be given at once to
Miss Clara.</p>

<p>"For me?" said Clara in astonishment, her curiosity very
much excited, "bring it in at once that I may see what it is
like."</p>

<p>Sebastian carried in a large covered basket and retired.</p>

<p>"I think the lessons had better be finished first before the
basket is unpacked," said Miss Rottermeyer.</p>

<p>Clara could not conceive what was in it, and cast longing
glances towards it. In the middle of one of her declensions
she suddenly broke off and said to the tutor, "Mayn't I just
give one peep inside to see what is in it before I go on?"</p>

<p>"On some considerations I am for it, on others against
it," he began in answer; "for it, on the ground that if your
whole attention is directed to the basket&mdash;" but the speech
remained unfinished. The cover of the basket was loose, and
at this moment one, two, three, and then two more kittens
came suddenly tumbling on to the floor and racing about the
room in every direction. They jumped over the tutor's boots,
climbed up Miss Rottermeyer's dress, rolled about her feet,
sprang up on to Clara's couch, scratching, scrambling, and
mewing. Clara kept on exclaiming, "Oh, the dear little
things! how pretty they are! Look, Heidi, at this one; look,
look, at that one over there!" And Heidi in her delight kept
running after them first into one corner and then into the
other. The tutor stood up by the table not knowing what to
do. Miss Rottermeyer was unable at first to speak at all, so
overcome was she with horror, and she did not dare rise from
her chair for fear that all the dreadful little animals should
jump upon her at once. At last she found voice to call loudly,
"Tinette! Tinette! Sebastian! Sebastian!"</p>

<p>They came in answer to her summons and gathered up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>
the kittens; by degrees they got them all inside the basket
again and then carried them off to put with the other two.</p>

<p>When Miss Rottermeyer learned that Heidi was to blame
for having the kittens brought into the house she was very
angry and said:</p>

<p>"Adelaide, you little barbarian, you shall be put in a dark
cellar with the rats and black beetles."</p>

<p>Heidi listened in silence and surprise to her sentence, for
she had never seen a cellar such as was now described; the
place known at her grandfather's as the cellar, where the
fresh cheeses and the new milk were kept, was a pleasant and
inviting place; neither did she know at all what rats and black
beetles were like.</p>

<p>But now Clara interrupted in great distress. "No, no,
Miss Rottermeyer, you must wait till papa comes; he has
written to say that he will soon be home, and then I will tell
him everything, and he will say what is to be done with
Heidi."</p>

<p>Miss Rottermeyer could not do anything against this superior
authority, especially as the father was really expected
very shortly. She rose and said with some displeasure,
"As you will, Clara, but I too shall have something to say to
Mr. Sesemann." And with that she left the room.</p>

<p>Two days now went by without further disturbance.
Miss Rottermeyer, however, could not recover her equanimity;
she was perpetually reminded by Heidi's presence of the
deception that had been played upon her, and it seemed to her
that ever since the child had come into the house everything
had been topsy-turvy, and she could not bring things into
proper order again. Clara had grown much more cheerful;
she no longer found time hang heavy during the lesson hours,
for Heidi was continually making a diversion of some kind or
other. She jumbled all her letters up together and seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
quite unable to learn them, and when the tutor tried to draw
her attention to their different shapes, and to help her by
showing her that this was like a little horn, or that like a
bird's bill, she would suddenly exclaim in a joyful voice,
"That is a goat!" "That is a bird of prey!". For the tutor's
descriptions suggested all kinds of pictures to her mind, but
left her still incapable of the alphabet. In the later afternoons
Heidi always sat with Clara, and told her of the mountain
and of her life upon it, and the longing to return would
become so overpowering that she always finished with the
words, "Now I must go home! tomorrow I must really go!"
But Clara would try to quiet her and tell Heidi that she must
wait till her father returned, and then they would see what
was to be done. After dinner Heidi had to sit alone in her
room for a couple of hours, for she understood now that she
might not run about outside at Frankfurt as she did on the
mountain, and so she did not attempt it.</p>

<p>At times she could hardly contain herself for the longing
to be back home again. She remembered that Dete had told
her that she could go home whenever she liked. So it came
about one day that Heidi felt she could not bear it any longer.
She tied all the rolls up in her red shawl, put on her straw
hat, and went downstairs. But just as she reached the hall-door
she met Miss Rottermeyer, just returning from a walk,
which put a stop to Heidi's journey.</p>

<p>"What have you dressed yourself like that for?" exclaimed
Miss Rottermeyer. "What do you mean by this?
Have I not strictly forbidden you to go running about in the
streets? And here you are ready to start off again, and going
out looking like a beggar."</p>

<p>"I was not going to run about, I was going home," said
Heidi frightened.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about! Going home! What would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>
Mr. Sesemann say if he knew! And what is the matter with
his house, I should like to know! Have you ever in your life
before had such a house to live in, such a table, or so many to
wait upon you? Have you?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Heidi.</p>

<p>"I should think not, indeed!" continued the exasperated
lady. "You are an ungrateful little thing to be always thinking
of what naughty thing you can do next!"</p>

<p>Then Heidi's feelings got the better of her, and she
poured forth her trouble. "Indeed I only want to go home,
for if I stay so long away Snowflake will begin crying again,
and grandmother is waiting for me, and Greenfinch will get
beaten, because I am not there to give Peter any cheese, and
I can never see here how the sun says good-night to the mountains;
and if the great bird were to fly over Frankfurt he would
croak louder than ever about people huddling all together and
teaching each other bad things, and not going to live up on the
rocks, where it is so much better."</p>

<p>"Heaven have mercy on us, the child is out of her mind!"
cried Miss Rottermeyer, and she turned and went quickly up
the steps. "Go and bring that unhappy little creature in at
once," she ordered Sebastian.</p>

<p>"What, are you in trouble again?" said Sebastian in a
pleasant voice, as he led Heidi back up the stairs. He tried to
cheer her up by telling her he was taking good care of all the
kittens. But she was too sad to care and silently crept away
to her room.</p>

<p>At supper that evening she sat without moving or eating;
all she did was to hastily hide her roll in her pocket.</p>

<p>Next day Miss Rottermeyer made up her mind that she
would supplement Heidi's clothing with various garments
from Clara's wardrobe, so as to give her a decent appearance
when Mr. Sesemann returned. She confided her intention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
Clara, who was quite willing to give up any number of dresses
and hats to Heidi; so the lady went upstairs to overhaul the
child's belongings and see what was to be kept and what
thrown away. She returned, however, in the course of a few
minutes with an expression of horror upon her face.</p>

<p>"What is this, Adelaide, that I find in your wardrobe!"
she exclaimed. "I never heard of any one doing such a thing
before! In a cupboard meant for clothes, Adelaide, what do I
see at the bottom but a heap of rolls! Will you believe it,
Clara, bread in a wardrobe! a whole pile of bread!"</p>

<p>"Tinette," she called, "go upstairs and take away all those
rolls out of Adelaide's cupboard and the old straw hat on the
table."</p>

<p>"No! no!" screamed Heidi. "I must keep the hat, and
the rolls are for grandmother," and she was rushing to stop
Tinette when Miss Rottermeyer caught hold of her: "You
will stop here, and all that bread and rubbish shall be taken to
the place they belong to," she said in a determined tone as
she kept her hand on the child to prevent her running forward.</p>

<p>Heidi flung herself down on Clara's couch and broke into
a wild fit of weeping, sobbing out at intervals, "Now grandmother's
bread is all gone! They were all for grandmother,
and now they are taken away, and grandmother won't have
one," and she wept as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>She could not get over her sobs for a long time; she would
never have been able to leave off crying at all if it had not been
for Clara's promise that she should have fresh, new rolls to
take to grandmother when the time came for her to go home.</p>

<p>When Heidi got into bed that night she found her old
straw hat lying under the counterpane. She snatched it up
with delight, made it more out of shape still in her joy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
then, after wrapping a handkerchief round it, she stuck it in
a corner of the cupboard as far back as she could.</p>

<p>It was Sebastian who had hidden it there for her; he had
been in the dining-room when Tinette was called, and had
heard all that went on with the child and the latter's loud
weeping. So he followed Tinette, and when she came out of
Heidi's room carrying the rolls and the hat, he caught up the
hat and said, "I will see to this old thing."</p>

<small>MR. SESEMANN TAKES HEIDI'S PART</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A&nbsp;<span class="smcap">few</span> days after these events there was great commotion
and much running up and down stairs in Mr. Sesemann's
house. The master had just returned, and Sebastian
and Tinette were busy carrying up one package after another
from the carriage, for Mr. Sesemann always brought back a
lot of pretty things for his home. He himself had not waited
to do anything before going in to see his daughter. Heidi was
sitting beside her, for it was late afternoon, when the two
were always together. Father and daughter greeted each
other with warm affection, for they were deeply attached to
one another. Then he held out his hand to Heidi, who had
stolen away into the corner, and said kindly to her, "And this
is our little Swiss girl; come and shake hands with me!
That's right! Now, tell me, are Clara and you good friends
with one another, or do you get angry and quarrel, and then
cry and make it up, and then start quarrelling again on the
next occasion?"</p>

<p>"No, Clara is always kind to me," answered Heidi.</p>

<p>"And Heidi," put in Clara quickly, "has not once tried
to quarrel."</p>

<p>"That's all right, I am glad to hear it," said her father,
as he rose from his chair. "But you must excuse me, Clara,
for I have had nothing to eat all day. Afterwards I will show
you all the things I have brought home with me."</p>

<p>He found Miss Rottermeyer in the dining-room and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>
he had taken his place she sat down opposite to him, looking
so gloomy that he turned to her and said, "What is the
matter?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Sesemann," began the lady in a solemn voice, "we
have been frightfully imposed upon."</p>

<p>"Indeed, in what way?" asked Mr. Sesemann as he went
on calmly drinking his wine.</p>

<p>"Well, I supposed I was getting a well-behaved and nicely
brought up little Swiss girl for Clara's companion but I have
been shockingly, disgracefully imposed upon."</p>

<p>"But how? what is there shocking and disgraceful? I
see nothing shocking in the child," remarked Mr. Sesemann
quietly.</p>

<p>"If you only knew the kind of people and animals she has
brought into the house during your absence! The tutor can
tell you more about that."</p>

<p>"Animals? what am I to understand by animals, Miss
Rottermeyer?"</p>

<p>"It is past understanding; the whole behavior of the
child would be past understanding, if it were not that at times
she is evidently not in her right mind."</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened and the tutor was announced.
"Ah! here is some one," exclaimed Mr. Sesemann,
"who will help to clear up matters for me. Take a seat," he
continued, as he held out his hand to the tutor. "And now tell
me, what is the matter with this child that has come to be a
companion to my daughter?"</p>

<p>The tutor started in his usual style. "If I must give my
opinion about this little girl, I should like first to state that,
if on one side, there is a lack of development which has been
caused by the more or less careless way in which she has been
brought up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My good friend," interrupted Mr. Sesemann, "you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
giving yourself more trouble than you need. I only want to
know what your opinion is as to her being a fit companion or
not for my daughter?"</p>

<p>"I should not like in any way to prejudice you against
her," began the tutor once more; "for if on the one hand there
is a certain inexperience of the ways of society, owing to the
uncivilized life she led up to the time of her removal to Frankfurt,
on the other hand she is endowed with certain good
qualities, and, taken on the whole&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, my dear sir, do not disturb yourself, but I
must&mdash;I think my daughter will be wanting me," and with
that Mr. Sesemann quickly left the room and went into the
study to talk to Clara.</p>

<p>"And now, my dear," he said, drawing his chair nearer
and laying her hand in his, "what kind of animals has your
little companion brought into the house, and why does Miss
Rottermeyer think that she is not always in her right mind?"</p>

<p>Clara had no difficulty in answering. She told her father
everything about the tortoise and the kittens, and explained
to him what Heidi had said the day Miss Rottermeyer had
been put in such a fright. Mr. Sesemann laughed heartily at
her recital. "So you do not want me to send the child home
again," he asked, "you are not tired of having her here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no," Clara exclaimed, "please do not send her
away. Time has passed much more quickly since Heidi has
been here, for something fresh happens every day, and it used
to be so dull, and she has always so much to tell me."</p>

<p>That evening when Mr. Sesemann and Miss Rottermeyer
were alone, settling the household affairs, he informed her
that he intended to keep Heidi, for his daughter liked her as a
companion. "I desire," he continued, "that the child shall
be in every way kindly treated, and that her peculiarities shall
not be looked upon as crimes. If you find her too much for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>
you alone, I can hold out a prospect of help for I am expecting
my mother here on a long visit, and she, as you know, can get
along with anybody, whatever they may be like."</p>

<p>"O yes, I know," replied Miss Rottermeyer, but there
was no tone of relief in her voice as she thought of the coming
help.</p>

<p>Mr. Sesemann was only home for a short time; he left for
Paris again before the fortnight was over, comforting Clara
with the prospect of her grandmother's arrival, which was to
take place in a few days' time. Clara talked so much about
her grandmother that Heidi began also to call her "grandmamma,"
which brought forth a look of displeasure from
Miss Rottermeyer. As she was going to her room that night,
Miss Rottermeyer waylaid her, and gave her strict orders not
to call Mrs. Sesemann "grandmamma," but always to say
"madam."</p>

<small>CLARA'S LOVABLE GRANDMOTHER</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">here</span> was much expectation and preparation about the
house on the following evening, for Grandmother Sesemann
was coming. Tinette had a new white cap on her head,
and Sebastian collected all the footstools he could find and
placed them in convenient spots, so that the lady might find
one ready to her feet whenever she chose to sit.</p>

<p>At last the carriage came driving up to the door, and
Tinette and Sebastian ran down the steps, followed by the
housekeeper, who advanced to greet the guest. Heidi had
been sent up to her room and ordered to remain there until
called down, as the grandmother would certainly like to see
Clara alone first. Heidi sat herself down in a corner and repeated
her instructions over to herself. She had not to wait
long before Tinette put her head in and said abruptly, "Go
downstairs into the study."</p>

<p>Heidi had not dared to ask Miss Rottermeyer again how
she was to address the grandmother: she thought the lady had
perhaps made a mistake, for she had never heard any one
called by other than their right name. As she opened the
study door she heard a kind voice say, "Ah, here comes the
child! Come along and let me have a good look at you."</p>

<p>Heidi walked up to her and said very distinctly in her
clear voice, "Good-evening, Mrs. Madam."</p>

<p>"Well!" said the grandmother laughing, "is that how
they address people in your home on the mountain?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span></p>

<p>"No," replied Heidi gravely, "I never knew any one with
that name before."</p>

<p>"Nor I either," laughed the grandmother again as she
patted Heidi's cheek. "Never mind! when I am with the
children I am always grandmamma; you won't forget that
name, will you?"</p>

<p>"No, no," Heidi assured her, "I often used to say it at
home."</p>

<p>"I understand," said the grandmother, with a cheerful
little nod of the head. Then she looked more closely at Heidi,
and the child looked back at her with steady, serious eyes, for
there was something kind and warm-hearted about this newcomer
that pleased Heidi, and indeed everything about the
grandmother attracted her. She had such beautiful white
hair, and two long lace ends hung down from the cap on her
head and waved gently about her face every time she moved,
as if a soft breeze were blowing round her, which gave Heidi
a peculiar feeling of pleasure.</p>

<p>"And what is your name, child?" the grandmother now
asked.</p>

<p>"I am always called Heidi; but as I am now to be called
Adelaide, I will try and take care&mdash;" Heidi stopped short, for
Miss Rottermeyer was at this moment entering the room.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sesemann will no doubt agree with me," she interrupted,
"that it was necessary to choose a name that could be
pronounced easily, if only for the sake of the servants."</p>

<p>"My worthy Rottermeyer," replied Mrs. Sesemann, "if
a person is called 'Heidi' and has grown accustomed to that
name, I call her by the same, and so let it be."</p>

<p>Miss Rottermeyer was always very much annoyed that
the old lady continually addressed her by her surname only;
but it was no use minding, for the grandmother always went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
her own way, and so there was no help for it. Moreover, the
grandmother was a keen old lady, and had all her five wits
about her, and she knew what was going on in the house as
soon as she entered it.</p>

<p>When on the following day Clara lay down as usual on
her couch after dinner, the grandmother sat down beside her
for a few minutes and closed her eyes, then she got up again as
lively as ever, and trotted off into the dining-room. No one
was there. "Heidi is asleep, I suppose," she said to herself,
and then going up to Miss Rottermeyer's room she gave a loud
knock at the door. She waited a few minutes and then Miss
Rottermeyer opened the door and drew back in surprise at
this unexpected visit.</p>

<p>"Where is the child, and what is she doing all this time?"
said Mrs. Sesemann.</p>

<p>"She is sitting in her room, where she could well employ
herself if she had the least idea of making herself useful; but
you have no idea, Mrs. Sesemann, of the out-of-the-way
things this child imagines and does."</p>

<p>"I should do the same if I had to sit in there like that
child, I can tell you; go bring her to my room; I have some
pretty books with me that I should like to give her."</p>

<p>"That is just the misfortune," said Miss Rottermeyer
with a despairing gesture, "what use are books to her? She
has not been able to learn her A B C's even, all the long time
she has been here; it is quite impossible to get the least idea of
them into her head, and that the tutor himself will tell you; if
he had not the patience of an angel he would have given up
teaching her long ago."</p>

<p>"That is very strange," said Mrs. Sesemann, "she does
not look to me like a child who would be unable to learn her
alphabet."</p>

<p>Heidi now appeared and gazed with open-eyed delight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>
and wonder at the beautiful colored pictures in the books
which the grandmother gave her to look at. All of a sudden
the child gave a start and burst into sobs, for she had turned
to a picture of a green pasture, full of young animals, some
grazing and others nibbling at the shrubs. In the middle was
a shepherd leaning upon his staff and looking on at his happy
flock.</p>

<p>The grandmother laid her hand kindly on Heidi's. "Don't
cry, dear child, don't cry," she said, "the picture has reminded
you perhaps of something. But see, there is a beautiful
tale to the picture which I will tell you this evening. And
there are other nice tales of all kinds to read and to tell again.
But now we must have a little talk together, so dry your tears
and come and stand in front of me and tell me how you are
getting on in your school-time; do you like your lessons, and
have you learnt a great deal?"</p>

<p>"O no!" replied Heidi sighing, "but I knew beforehand
that it was not possible to learn."</p>

<p>"What is it you think impossible to learn?"</p>

<p>"Why, to read, it is too difficult."</p>

<p>"You don't say so! and who told you that?"</p>

<p>"Peter told me, and he knew all about it, for he had tried
and tried and could not learn it."</p>

<p>"Peter must be a very odd boy then! But listen, Heidi,
you must not always go by what Peter says. You must believe
what I tell you&mdash;and I tell you that you can learn to read
in a very little while, as many other children do, who are made
like you and not like Peter. As soon as you are able to read
you shall have that book for your own."</p>

<p>Heidi had listened with eager attention to the grandmother's
words and now with a sigh exclaimed, "Oh, if only
I could read now!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span></p>

<p>"It won't take you long now to learn, that I can see; and
now we must go down to Clara; bring the books with you."
And hand in hand the two returned to the study.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since the day when Heidi had so longed to go home, and
Miss Rottermeyer had met her and scolded her on the steps,
and told her how wicked and ungrateful she was to try and
run away, a change had come over the child. She at last understood
that she could not go home when she wished as Dete
had told her, but that she would have to stay on in Frankfurt
for a long, long time, perhaps for ever. The weight of trouble
on the little heart grew heavier and heavier; she could no
longer eat her food, and every day she grew a little paler. She
lay awake for long hours at night, for as soon as she was alone
and everything was still around her, the picture of the mountain
with its sunshine and flowers rose vividly before her eyes;
and when at last she fell asleep it was to dream of the rocks
and the snow-field turning crimson in the evening light, and
waking in the morning she would think herself back at the hut
and prepare to run joyfully out into the sun&mdash;and then&mdash;there
was her large bed, and here she was in Frankfurt far, far away
from home. And Heidi would often lay her face down on the
pillow and weep long and quietly so that no one might hear
her.</p>

<p>Her unhappiness did not escape the grandmother's notice.
One day she called her into her room, and said, "Now tell me,
Heidi, what is the matter; are you in trouble?"</p>

<p>But Heidi, afraid if she told the truth that the grandmother
would think her ungrateful, and would then leave off
being so kind to her, answered, "I can't tell you."</p>

<p>"Well, could you tell Clara about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, I cannot tell any one," said Heidi in so positive a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>
tone, and with a look of such trouble on her face, that the
grandmother felt full of pity for the child.</p>

<p>"Then, dear child, let me tell you what to do: you know
that when we are in great trouble, and cannot speak about it
to anybody, we must turn to God and pray Him to help. You
say your prayers every evening do you not?"</p>

<p>"No, I never say any prayers," answered Heidi.</p>

<p>"Have you never been taught to pray, Heidi; do you not
know even what it means?"</p>

<p>"I used to say prayers with the first grandmother, but
that is a long time ago, and I have forgotten them."</p>

<p>"That is the reason, Heidi, that you are so unhappy, because
you know no one who can help you. Think what a comfort
it is to be able to tell everything to God, and pray Him
for the help that no one else can give us. And He can aid us
and give us everything that will make us happy again."</p>

<p>A sudden gleam of joy came into Heidi's eyes. "May I
tell Him everything, everything?"</p>

<p>"Yes, everything, Heidi, everything."</p>

<p>Heidi drew her hand away, which the grandmother was
holding affectionately between her own, and said quickly,
"May I go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," was the answer, and Heidi ran out of
the room into her own, and sitting herself on a stool, folded
her hands together and told God about everything that was
making her so sad and unhappy, and begged Him earnestly
to help her and to let her go home to her grandfather.</p>

<p>It was about a week after this that the tutor informed
Mrs. Sesemann that Heidi had really learnt to read at last.</p>


<p>"It is indeed truly marvelous," he said, "because she
never seemed able to even learn her A B C's before. I had
made up my mind to make no further attempts at the impossible,
but to put the letters as they were before her without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
any dissertation on their origin and meaning. Now she has
learnt her letters and started at once to read correctly, quite
unlike most beginners."</p>

<p>That same evening Heidi found the large book with the
pictures, lying on her plate when she took her place at table,
and when she looked questioningly at the grandmother, the
latter nodded kindly to her and said, "Yes, it's yours now."</p>

<p>"Mine, to keep always? even when I go home?" said
Heidi, blushing with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, yours for ever," the grandmother assured
her. "Tomorrow we will begin to read it."</p>

<p>"But you are not going home yet, Heidi, not for years,"
put in Clara. "When grandmother goes away, I shall want
you to stay on with me."</p>

<p>When Heidi went to her room that night she had another
look at her book before going to bed, and from that day forth
her chief pleasure was to read over and over again, the tales
which belonged to the beautiful pictures.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="ChXI." id="ChXI."></a>CHAPTER XI<br />
<small>HOME-SICKNESS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">E<span class="smcap">very</span> afternoon when Clara was resting after dinner,
the grandmother would take Heidi to her own room
where she had a lot of pretty dolls, and she showed her how to
make dresses and aprons for them, so that the child learned
how to sew and to make all sorts of beautiful clothes for the
little people. And then grandmother liked to hear her read
aloud, and the oftener Heidi read her tales the fonder she
grew of them. But still she never looked really happy, and
her eyes were no longer bright.</p>

<p>It was the last week of the grandmother's visit. She
called Heidi into her room as usual one day after dinner, and
the child came with her book under her arm. The old lady
laid the book aside, and said, "Now, my dear, tell me why you
are not happy? Have you still the same trouble at heart?"</p>

<p>Heidi nodded in reply.</p>

<p>"Have you told God about it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And do you pray every day that He will make things
right and that you may be happy again?"</p>

<p>"No, I have left off praying."</p>

<p>"Do not tell me that, Heidi! Why have you left off
praying?"</p>


<p>"It is of no use, God does not listen," Heidi went on in an
agitated voice, "and I can understand that when there are so
many, many people in Frankfurt praying to Him every evening
that He cannot attend to them all, and He certainly has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>
not heard what I said to Him."</p>

<p>"And why are you so sure of that, Heidi?"</p>

<p>"Because I have prayed for the same thing every day for
weeks, and yet God has not done what I asked."</p>

<p>"You are wrong, Heidi; you must not think of Him like
that. God is a good father to us all, and knows better than
we do what is good for us. He did not think what you have
been praying for was good for you just now; but be sure He
heard you, for He can hear and see every one at the same time,
because He is a God and not a human being like you and me.
While God is watching over you, and looking to see if you will
trust Him and go on praying to Him every day, you run away
and leave off saying your prayers, and forget all about Him.
You would not like to grieve God, would you, Heidi, when He
only wants to be kind to you? So will you not go and ask Him
to forgive you, and continue to pray and to trust Him, for
you may be sure that He will make everything right and
happy for you, and then you will be glad and lighthearted
again."</p>

<p>Heidi had perfect confidence in the grandmother, and
every word she said sank into her heart.</p>

<p>"I will go at once and ask God to forgive me, and I will
never forget Him again," she replied repentantly.</p>

<p>And she ran away and prayed that she might always remember
God, and that He would go on thinking about her.</p>

<p>The day came for grandmother's departure&mdash;a sad one
for Clara and Heidi. But the grandmother was determined
to make it as much like a holiday as possible and not to let
them mope, and she kept them so lively and amused that they
had no time to think about their sorrow at her going until she
really drove away. Then the house seemed so silent and
empty that Heidi and Clara did not know what to do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>
themselves, and sat during the remainder of the day like two
lost children.</p>

<p>Many weeks passed away. Heidi did not know if it was
winter or summer, for the walls and windows she looked out
upon showed no change, and she never went beyond the house
except on rare occasions when Clara was well enough to drive
out, and then they only went a very little way, as Clara could
not bear the movement for long. On these occasions they
generally only saw more fine streets and large houses and
crowds of people; they seldom got anywhere beyond them, and
grass and flowers, fir trees and mountains, were still far away.
Heidi's longing for the old familiar and beautiful things grew
daily stronger, so that now only to read a word that recalled
them to her remembrance brought her to the verge of tears,
which she suppressed with difficulty. So the autumn and
winter passed, and again the sun came shining down on the
white walls of the opposite houses, and Heidi would think to
herself that now the time had come for Peter to go out again
with the goats, to where the golden flowers of the cistus were
glowing in the sunlight, and all the rocks around turned to fire
at sunset. She would go and sit in a corner of her lonely room
and put her hands up to her eyes that she might not see the
sun shining on the opposite wall; and then she would remain
without moving, battling silently with her terrible home-sickness
until Clara sent for her again.</p>

<small>"MY HOUSE IS HAUNTED"</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">F<span class="smcap">or</span> some days past Miss Rottermeyer had gone about
rather silently and as if lost in thought. As twilight fell,
and she passed from room to room, or along the long corridors,
she was seen to look cautiously behind her, and into the dark
corners, as if she thought some one was coming up silently
behind her and might unexpectedly give her dress a pull. Nor
would she now go alone into some parts of the house. If she
visited the upper floor where the grand guest-chambers were,
or had to go down into the large drawing room, where every
footstep echoed, she called Tinette to accompany her.</p>

<p>For something very strange and mysterious was going on
in Mr. Sesemann's house. Every morning, when the servants
went downstairs, they found the front door wide open, although
nobody could be seen far or near to account for it.
During the first few days that this happened every room and
corner was searched in great alarm, to see if anything had
been stolen, for the general idea was that a thief had been hiding
in the house and had gone off in the night with the stolen
goods; but not a thing in the house had been touched, everything
was safe in its place. The door was doubly locked at
night, and for further security the wooden bar was fastened
across it; but it was no good&mdash;next morning the door again
stood open. At last, after a great deal of persuasion from
Miss Rottermeyer, Sebastian and John plucked up courage
and agreed to sit up one night to watch and see what would
happen. Miss Rottermeyer hunted up several weapons belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>
to the master, and gave these and a bottle of brandy
to them so that their courage might not faint if it came to a
fight.</p>

<p>On the appointed night the two sat down and began at
once to take some of the strengthening cordial, which at first
made them very talkative and then very sleepy, so that they
leant back in their seats and became silent. As midnight
struck, Sebastian roused himself and called to his companion,
who, however, was not easy to wake, and kept rolling his head
first to one side and then the other and continuing to sleep.
Sebastian began to listen more attentively, for he was wide
awake now. He did not feel inclined to go to sleep again, for
the stillness was ghostly to him, and he was afraid now to
raise his voice to rouse John, so he shook him gently to make
him stir. At last, as one struck, John woke up, and came
back to the consciousness of why he was sitting in a chair instead
of lying in his bed. He got up with a great show of courage
and said, "Come, Sebastian, we must go out in the hall and
see what is going on; you need not be afraid, just follow me."</p>

<p>Whereupon he opened the door wide and stepped into the
hall. Just as he did so a sudden gust of air blew through the
open front door and put out the light which John held in his
hand. He started back, almost overturning Sebastian, whom
he clutched and pulled back into the room, and then shutting
the door quickly he turned the key as far as he could make it
go. Then he pulled out his matches and lighted his candle
again. Sebastian, in the suddenness of the affair, did not
know exactly what had happened, for he had not seen the open
front door or felt the breeze behind John's broad figure. But
now, as he saw the latter in the light, he gave a cry of alarm,
for John was trembling all over and was as white as a ghost.
"What's the matter? What did you see outside?" asked
Sebastian sympathetically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span></p>

<p>"The door partly open," gasped John, "and a white
figure standing at the top of the steps&mdash;there it stood, and
then all in a minute it disappeared."</p>

<p>Sebastian felt his blood run cold. The two sat down close
to one another and did not dare move again till the morning
broke and the streets began to be alive again. Then they left
the room together, shut the front door, and went upstairs to
tell Miss Rottermeyer of their experience. They had no
sooner given her details of the night's experience than she sat
down and wrote to Mr. Sesemann, who had never received
such a letter before in his life. She could hardly write, she
told him, for her fingers were stiff with fear, and Mr. Sesemann
must please arrange to come back at once, for dreadful
and unaccountable things were taking place at home. Then
she entered into particulars of all that had happened, of how
the door was found standing open every morning.</p>

<p>Mr. Sesemann answered that it was quite impossible for
him to arrange to leave his business and return home at once.</p>

<p>Miss Rottermeyer, however, was determined not to pass
any more days in a state of fear, and she knew the right course
to pursue. She had as yet said nothing to the children of the
ghostly apparitions, for she knew if she did that the children
would not remain alone for a single moment, and that might
entail discomfort for herself. But now she walked straight
off into the study, and there in a low, mysterious voice told the
two children everything that had taken place. Clara immediately
screamed out that she could not remain another
minute alone, her father must come home.</p>

<p>So Miss Rottermeyer wrote another letter to Mr. Sesemann,
stating that these unaccountable things that were going
on in the house had so affected his daughter's delicate
constitution that the worst consequences might be expected.
Epileptic fits and St. Vitus's dance often came on suddenly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>
cases like this, and Clara was liable to be attacked by either if
the cause of the general alarm was not removed.</p>

<p>The letter was successful, and two days later Mr. Sesemann
arrived home.</p>

<p>Clara greeted him with a cry of joy, and seeing her so
lively and apparently as well as ever, his face cleared, and
the frown of anxiety passed gradually away from it as he
heard from his daughter's own lips that she had nothing the
matter with her, and moreover was so delighted to see him
that she was quite glad about the ghost, as it was the cause of
bringing him home again.</p>

<p>"And how is the ghost getting on?" he asked, turning to
Miss Rottermeyer, with a twinkle of amusement in his eye.</p>

<p>"It is no joke, I assure you," replied that lady. "You
will not laugh yourself tomorrow morning, Mr. Sesemann;
what is going on in the house points to some terrible thing
that has taken place in the past and been concealed."</p>

<p>"Well, I know nothing about that," said the master of
the house, "but I must beg you not to bring suspicion on my
worthy ancestors. And now will you kindly call Sebastian
into the dining-room, as I wish to speak to him alone."</p>

<p>Mr. Sesemann had been quite aware that Sebastian and
Miss Rottermeyer were not on the best of terms, and he had
his ideas about this scare.</p>

<p>"Come here, lad," he said as Sebastian appeared, "and
tell me frankly&mdash;have you been playing at ghosts to amuse
yourself at Miss Rottermeyer's expense?"</p>

<p>"No, on my honor, sir; pray, do not think it; I am very
uncomfortable about the matter myself," answered Sebastian
with unmistakable truthfulness.</p>

<p>"Well, if that is so, I will show you and John tomorrow
morning how ghosts look in the daylight. You ought to be
ashamed of yourself, Sebastian, a great strong lad like you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>
to run away from a ghost! But now go and take a message to
my old friend the doctor: give him my kind regards, and ask
if he will come to me tonight at nine o'clock without fail; I
have come by express from Paris to consult him. I shall want
him to spend the night here, so bad a case is it; so will he arrange
accordingly. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Sebastian, "I will see to the matter
as you wish."</p>

<p>Punctually at nine o'clock, after the children and Miss
Rottermeyer had retired, the doctor arrived. He was a grey-haired
man with a fresh face, and two bright, kindly eyes. He
looked anxious as he walked in, but, on catching sight of his
patient, burst out laughing and clapped him on the shoulder.
"Well," he said, "you look pretty bad for a person that I am
to sit up with all night."</p>

<p>"Patience, friend," answered Mr. Sesemann, "the one
you have to sit up for will look a good deal worse when we
have once caught him, for there is a ghost in the house!"</p>

<p>The doctor laughed again.</p>

<p>"That's a nice way of showing sympathy, doctor!" continued
Mr. Sesemann. "It's a pity my friend Rottermeyer
cannot hear you. She is firmly convinced that some old member
of the family is wandering about the house doing penance
for some awful crime he committed."</p>

<p>"How did she become acquainted with him?" asked the
doctor, still very much amused.</p>

<p>So Mr. Sesemann recounted to him how the front door
was nightly opened by somebody, according to the testimony
of the combined household. The whole thing was either a joke
gotten up by some friend of the servants, just to alarm the
household while he was away or else it was a thief, who, by
leading everybody at first to think there was a ghost, made it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>
safe for himself when he came later to steal, as no one would
venture to run out if they heard him.</p>

<p>The two took up their quarters for the night in the same
room in which Sebastian and John had kept watch. The door
was shut close to prevent the light being seen in the hall outside,
which might frighten away the ghost. The gentlemen
sat comfortably back in the arm-chairs and began talking of
all sorts of things, now and then pausing to take a good
draught of wine, and so twelve o'clock struck before they were
aware.</p>

<p>"The ghost has got scent of us and is keeping away tonight,"
said the doctor.</p>

<p>"Wait a bit, it does not generally appear before one
o'clock," answered his friend.</p>

<p>They started talking again. One o'clock struck. There
was not a sound about the house, nor in the street outside.
Suddenly the doctor lifted his finger.</p>

<p>"Hush! Sesemann, don't you hear something?"</p>

<p>They both listened, and they distinctly heard the bar
softly pushed aside and then the key turned in the lock and
the door opened. Mr. Sesemann put out his hand for his
revolver.</p>

<p>"You are not afraid, are you?" said the doctor as he
stood up.</p>

<p>"It is better to take precautions," whispered Mr. Sesemann,
and seizing one of the lights in his other hand, he followed
the doctor, who, armed in like manner with a light and
a revolver, went softly on in front. They stepped into the
hall. The moonlight was shining in through the open door and
fell on a white figure standing motionless in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" thundered the doctor in a voice that
echoed through the hall, as the two men advanced with lights
and weapons towards the figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span></p>

<p>It turned and gave a low cry. There in her little white
nightgown stood Heidi, with bare feet, staring with wild eyes
at the lights and the revolvers, and trembling from head to
foot like a leaf in the wind. The two men looked at one another
in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, I believe it is Heidi," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"Child, what does this mean?" said Mr. Sesemann.
"What did you want? why did you come down here?"</p>

<p>White with terror, and hardly able to make her voice
heard, Heidi answered, "I don't know."</p>

<p>But now the doctor stepped forward. "This is a matter
for me to see to, Sesemann; go back to your chair. I must take
the child upstairs to her bed."</p>

<p>And with that he put down his revolver and gently taking
the child by the hand led her upstairs. "Don't be frightened,"
he said as they went up side by side, "it's nothing to be
frightened about; it's all right, only just go quietly."</p>

<p>On reaching Heidi's room the doctor put the candle down
on the table, and taking Heidi up in his arms laid her on the
bed and carefully covered her over. Then he sat down beside
her and waited until she had grown quieter and no longer
trembled so violently. He then took her hand and said in a
kind, soothing voice, "There, now you feel better, and now tell
me where you were wanting to go to?"</p>

<p>"I did not want to go anywhere," said Heidi. "I did not
know I went downstairs, but all at once I was there."</p>

<p>"I see, and had you been dreaming, so that you seemed to
see and hear something very distinctly?"</p>


<p>"Yes, I dream every night, and always about the same
things. I think I am back with grandfather, and I hear the
sound in the fir trees outside, and I see the stars shining so
brightly, and then I open the door quickly and run out, and it
is all so beautiful! But when I wake I am still in Frankfurt."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>
And Heidi struggled as she spoke to keep back the sobs which
seemed to choke her.</p>

<p>"And have you no pain anywhere? no pain in your head
or back?"</p>

<p>"No, only a feeling as if there were a great stone weighing
on me here."</p>

<p>"As if you had eaten something that would not go down."</p>

<p>"No, not like that; something heavy as if I wanted to cry
very much."</p>

<p>"I see, and then do you have a good cry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I mustn't; Miss Rottermeyer forbade me to
cry."</p>

<p>"So you swallow it all down, I suppose? Are you happy
here in Frankfurt?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the low answer; but it sounded more like
"No."</p>

<p>"And where did you live with your grandfather?"</p>

<p>"Up on the mountain."</p>

<p>"That wasn't very amusing; rather dull at times, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, no, it was beautiful, beautiful!" Heidi could go no
further; the remembrance of the past, the excitement she had
just gone through, the long suppressed weeping, were too
much for the child's strength; the tears began to fall fast, and
she broke into violent weeping.</p>

<p>The doctor patted her head kindly. "There, there, go on
crying, it will do you good, and then go to sleep: it will be all
right tomorrow."</p>

<p>Then he left the room and went downstairs to Mr. Sesemann;
when he was once more sitting in the arm-chair opposite
his friend, "Sesemann," he said, "let me first tell you
that your little charge is a sleep-walker; she is the ghost who
has nightly opened the front door and put your household into
this fever of alarm. Secondly, the child is consumed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>
home-sickness to such an extent that she is nearly a skeleton
already, and soon will be quite one; something must be done
at once. There is but one remedy and that is to send her back
to her native mountain air. So tomorrow the child must start
for home; there you have my prescription."</p>

<p>Mr. Sesemann had risen and now paced up and down the
room in the greatest state of concern.</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed, "the child a sleep-walker and ill!
All this has taken place in my house and no one noticed it!
And you mean, doctor, that the child who came here happy
and healthy, I am to send back to her grandfather a miserable
little skeleton? I can't do it; you cannot dream of my doing
such a thing! Take the child in hand, do with her what you
will, and make her whole and sound, and then she shall go
home; but you must cure her first."</p>

<p>"Sesemann," replied the doctor, "this illness of the
child's is not one to be cured with pills and powders. The
child has not a strong constitution, but if you send her back at
once she may recover in the mountain air, if not&mdash;you would
rather she went back ill than not at all?"</p>

<p>Mr. Sesemann stood still; the doctor's words were a shock
to him.</p>

<p>"If you put it so, doctor, there is assuredly only one way&mdash;and
that is to send her home at once."</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="ChXIII." id="ChXIII."></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<small>AT HOME AGAIN ON THE MOUNTAIN</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A<span class="smcap">t</span> daylight Mr. Sesemann went quickly upstairs and
along the passage to Miss Rottermeyer's room, and there
gave such an unusually loud knock at the door that the lady
awoke from sleep with a cry of alarm. She heard the master
of the house calling to her from the other side of the door,
"Please make haste and come down to the dining-room; we
must make ready for a journey at once."</p>

<p>When Miss Rottermeyer came down, with everything
well adjusted about her except her cap, which was put on hind
side before, Mr. Sesemann began without delay to give her directions.
She was to get out a trunk and pack up all the things
belonging to Heidi, and a good part of Clara's clothes as well,
so that the child might take home proper apparel.</p>

<p>Miss Rottermeyer stood as if rooted to the spot and stared
in astonishment at Mr. Sesemann. She had quite expected a
long private account of some terrible ghostly experience of his
during the night.</p>

<p>But Mr. Sesemann had no thought or time for explanations
and left her standing there while he went to speak to
Clara. He told her everything that had occurred during the
past night, and explained how Heidi's nightly wanderings
might gradually lead her farther and farther, perhaps even on
to the roof, which of course would be very dangerous for her.
And so they had decided to send her home at once, as he did
not like to take the responsibility of her remaining, and Clara
would see for herself that it was the only thing to do. Clara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span>
was very much distressed, and at first made all kinds of suggestions
for keeping Heidi with her; but her father was firm,
and promised her, if she would be reasonable and make no
further fuss, that he would take her to Switzerland next
summer.</p>

<p>Next he sent for Sebastian and told him to make ready
to start: he was to travel with Heidi as far as Basle that day,
and the next day take her home. He would give him a letter
to carry to the grandfather, which would explain everything,
and he could then return to Frankfurt.</p>

<p>"But there is one thing in particular which I wish you to
look after," said Mr. Sesemann in conclusion. "When you
reach the hotel, go at once into the child's room and see that
the windows are all firmly fastened so that they cannot be
easily opened. After Heidi is in bed, lock the door of her room
on the outside, for the child walks in her sleep and might run
into danger in a strange house if she went wandering downstairs
and tried to open the front door; so you understand?"</p>

<p>"Oh! then that was it?" exclaimed Sebastian, for now a
light was thrown on the ghostly visitations.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was it! and you are a coward, and you may tell
John he is the same, and the whole household a pack of
idiots." And with this Mr. Sesemann went off to his study to
write a letter to Alm-Uncle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Heidi was standing expectantly dressed in
her Sunday frock waiting to see what would happen next, for
Tinette had awakened her with a shake and put on her clothes
without a word of explanation. The little uneducated child
was far too much beneath her for Tinette to speak to.</p>

<p>When she appeared at the breakfast table, Mr. Sesemann
said: "You are going home today, little one."</p>

<p>"Home?" murmured Heidi in a low voice, turning pale;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>
she was so overcome that for a moment or two she could hardly
breathe.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to hear more about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes!" exclaimed Heidi, her face now rosy with
delight.</p>

<p>"All right, then," said Mr. Sesemann as he sat down and
made her a sign to do the same, "but now eat a good breakfast,
and then off you go in the carriage."</p>

<p>But Heidi could not swallow a morsel though she tried to
do what she was told; she was in such a state of excitement
that she hardly knew if she was awake or dreaming, or if she
would again open her eyes to find herself in her nightgown at
the front door.</p>

<p>"Tell Sebastian to take plenty of provisions with him,"
Mr. Sesemann called out to Miss Rottermeyer, who just then
came into the room; "the child can't eat anything now, which
is quite natural. Now run up to Clara and stay with her till
the carriage comes round," he added kindly, turning to Heidi.</p>

<p>Heidi had been longing for this, and ran quickly upstairs.
An immense trunk was standing open in the middle of the
room.</p>

<p>"Oh Heidi," cried Clara, as she entered; "see all the
things I have had put in for you&mdash;aren't you pleased?"</p>

<p>And she ran over a list of things, dresses and aprons and
handkerchiefs, and all kinds of working materials. "And
look here," she added, as she triumphantly held up a basket.
Heidi peeped in and jumped for joy, for inside it were twelve
beautiful round white rolls, all for grandmother. In their delight
the children forgot that the time had come for them to
separate, and when some one called out, "The carriage is
here," there was no time for grieving.</p>

<p>Heidi ran to her room to fetch her darling book; she knew
no one could have packed that, as it lay under her pillow, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span>
she had kept it by her night and day. This was put in the
basket with the rolls. Then she opened her wardrobe to look
for another treasure&mdash;the old red shawl which had been left
behind. Heidi wrapped it round her old hat and laid it on the
top of the basket, so that the red package was quite conspicuous.
Then she put on her pretty hat and left the room. Miss
Rottermeyer was waiting at the top of the stairs to say good-bye
to her. When she caught sight of the strange little red
bundle, she took it out of the basket and threw it on the
ground. "No, no, Adelaide," she exclaimed, "you cannot
leave the house with that thing. What can you possibly want
with it!" Heidi did not dare take up her little bundle, but she
gave the master of the house an imploring look, as if her
greatest treasure had been taken from her.</p>

<p>"No, no," said Mr. Sesemann in a very decided voice,
"the child shall take home with her whatever she likes, kittens
and tortoises, if it pleases her; we need not put ourselves out
about that, Miss Rottermeyer."</p>

<p>Heidi quickly picked up her bundle, with a look of joy
and gratitude. As she stood by the carriage door, Mr. Sesemann
gave her his hand and said he hoped she would remember
him and Clara. He wished her a happy journey, and
Heidi thanked him for all his kindness, and added, "And
please say good-bye to the doctor for me and give him many,
many thanks." For she had not forgotten that he had said
to her the night before, 'It will be all right tomorrow,' and she
rightly divined that he had helped to make it so for her.
Heidi was now lifted into the carriage, and then the basket
and the provisions were put in, and finally Sebastian took his
place. Then Mr. Sesemann called out once more, "A pleasant
journey to you," and the carriage rolled away.</p>

<p>Heidi was soon sitting in the railway carriage, holding
her basket tightly on her lap; she would not let it out of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span>
hands for a moment, for it contained the delicious rolls for
grandmother; so she must keep it carefully, and even peep inside
it from time to time to enjoy the sight of them. For
many hours she sat as still as a mouse; only now was she beginning
to realize that she was going home to the grandfather,
the mountain, the grandmother, and Peter. All of a sudden
she said anxiously, "Sebastian, are you sure that grandmother
on the mountain is not dead?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Sebastian, wishing to soothe her, "we will
hope not; she is sure to be alive still."</p>

<p>Then Heidi fell back on her own thoughts again. Now
and then she looked inside the basket, for the thing she looked
forward to most was laying all the rolls out on grandmother's
table. After a long silence she spoke again, "If only we could
know for certain that grandmother is alive!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Sebastian half asleep, "she is sure to be
alive, there is no reason why she should be dead."</p>

<p>After a while sleep came to Heidi too, and after her disturbed
night and early rising she slept so soundly that she
did not wake till Sebastian shook her by the arm and called
to her, "Wake up, wake up! we shall have to get out directly;
we are just in Basle!"</p>

<p>There was a further railway journey of many hours the
next day. Heidi again sat with her basket on her knee, for she
would not have given it up to Sebastian on any consideration;
today she never even opened her mouth, for her excitement,
which increased with every mile of the journey, kept her
speechless. All of a sudden, before Heidi expected it, a voice
called out, "Mayenfeld." She and Sebastian both jumped
up, the latter also taken by surprise. In another minute they
were both standing on the platform with Heidi's trunk, and
the train was steaming away down the valley. Sebastian
looked after it regretfully, for he preferred the easier mode of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>
travelling to a wearisome climb on foot, especially as there
was danger no doubt as well as fatigue in a country like this,
where, according to Sebastian's idea, everything and everybody
were half savage. He therefore looked cautiously to
either side to see who was a likely person to ask the safest
way to Doerfli.</p>

<p>Just outside the station he saw a shabby-looking little
cart and horse which a broad-shouldered man was loading
with heavy sacks that had been brought by the train, so he
went up to him and asked which was the safest way to get to
Doerfli.</p>

<p>"All the roads about here are safe," was the curt reply.</p>

<p>So Sebastian altered his question and asked which was
the best way to avoid falling over the precipice, and also how
a trunk could be conveyed to Doerfli. The man looked at it,
weighing it with his eye, and then volunteered if it was not too
heavy to take it on his own cart, as he was driving to Doerfli.
After some little interchange of words it was finally agreed
that the man should take both the child and the trunk to
Doerfli, and there find some one who could be sent on with
Heidi up the mountain.</p>

<p>"I can go by myself, I know the way well from Doerfli,"
put in Heidi, who had been listening attentively to the conversation.
Sebastian was greatly relieved at not having to do
any mountain climbing. He drew Heidi aside and gave her a
thick rolled parcel, and a letter for her grandfather; the
parcel, he told her, was a present from Mr. Sesemann, and she
must put it at the bottom of her basket under the rolls and be
very careful not to lose it, as Mr. Sesemann would be very
vexed if she did.</p>

<p>"I shall be sure not to lose it," said Heidi confidently, and
she at once put the roll and the letter at the bottom of her
basket. The trunk meanwhile had been hoisted into the cart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span>
and now Sebastian lifted Heidi and her basket on to the high
seat and shook hands with her. The driver swung himself up
beside Heidi, and the cart rolled away in the direction, of the
mountains, while Sebastian, glad of having no tiring and dangerous
journey on foot before him, sat down in the station and
awaited the return train.</p>

<p>The driver of the cart was the miller at Doerfli and was
taking home his sacks of flour. He had never seen Heidi, but
like everybody in Doerfli knew all about her. He had known
her parents, and felt sure at once that this was the child of
whom he had heard so much. He began to wonder why she
had come back, and as they drove along he entered into conversation
with her. "You are the child who lived with your
grandfather, Alm-Uncle, are you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Didn't they treat you well down there that you have
come back so soon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was not that; everything in Frankfurt is as nice
as it could be."</p>

<p>"Then why are you running home again?"</p>

<p>"Only because Mr. Sesemann gave me leave, or else I
should not have come."</p>

<p>"If they were willing to let you stay, why did you not
remain where you were better off than at home?"</p>

<p>"Because I would a thousand times rather be with grandfather
on the mountain than anywhere else in the world."</p>

<p>"You will think differently perhaps when you get back
there," grumbled the miller; and then to himself, "It's
strange of her, for she must know what it's like."</p>

<p>He began whistling and said no more, while Heidi looked
around her and began to tremble with excitement, for she
knew every tree along the way, and there overhead were the
high jagged peaks of the mountain looking down on her like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>
old friends. She nodded back to them, and grew every moment
more wild with her joy and longing, feeling as if she
must jump down from the cart and run with all her might till
she reached the top. The clock was striking five as they
drove into Doerfli. As the miller lifted Heidi down, she said
hastily, "Thank you, grandfather will send for the trunk."</p>

<p>She climbed up the steep path from Doerfli as quickly as
she could; she was obliged, however, to pause now and again
to take breath, for the basket she carried was rather heavy,
and the way got steeper as she drew nearer the top. One
thought alone filled Heidi's mind, "Would she find the grandmother
sitting in her usual corner by the spinning-wheel, was
she still alive?" At last Heidi caught sight of the grandmother's
house in the hollow of the mountain and her heart
began to beat; she ran faster and faster and her heart beat
louder and louder&mdash;and now she had reached the house, but
she trembled so she could hardly open the door&mdash;and then she
was standing inside, unable in her breathlessness to utter a
sound.</p>

<p>"Ah, my God!" cried a voice from the corner, "that was
how Heidi used to run in; if only I could have her with me once
again! Who is there?"</p>

<p>"It's I, I, Grandmother," cried Heidi as she ran and flung
herself on her knees beside the old woman, and seizing her
hands, clung to her, unable to speak for joy. And the grandmother
herself could not say a word for some time, so unexpected
was this happiness; but at last she put out her hand
and stroked Heidi's curly hair, and said, "Yes, yes, that is her
hair, and her voice; thank God that He has granted my
prayer!" And tears of joy fell from the blind eyes on to
Heidi's hand. "Is it really you, Heidi; have you really come
back to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Grandmother, I am really here," answered Heidi in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span>
a reassuring voice. "Do not cry, for I have really come back
and I am never going away again, and I shall come every
day to see you, and you won't have any more hard bread to
eat for some days, for look, look!"</p>

<p>And Heidi took the rolls from the basket, and piled the
whole twelve up on grandmother's lap.</p>

<p>"Ah, child! child! what a blessing you bring with you!"
the old woman exclaimed, as she felt and seemed never to
come to the end of the rolls. "But you yourself are the greatest
blessing."</p>

<p>Then Heidi told her how unhappy she had been, thinking
that the grandmother might die while she was away and
would never have her white rolls, and that then she would
never, never see her again.</p>

<p>Peter's mother came in and stood for a moment overcome
with astonishment. "Why, it's Heidi," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Heidi stood up, and Brigitta could not say enough in her
admiration of the child's dress and appearance; she walked
round her, exclaiming all the while, "Grandmother, if you
could only see her, and see what a pretty frock she has on; you
would hardly know her again. And the hat with the feather
in it is yours too, I suppose? Put it on that I may see how
you look in it?"</p>

<p>"No, I would rather not," replied Heidi firmly. "You
can have it if you like; I do not want it; I have my own still."
And Heidi so saying undid her red bundle and took out her
own hat, which had become a little more battered still during
the journey. She had not forgotten how her grandfather had
called out to Dete that he never wished to see her and her hat
and feathers again, and this was the reason she had so anxiously
preserved her old hat, for she had never ceased to
think about going home to her grandfather. Next she took
off her pretty dress and put her red shawl on over her underpetticoat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span>
which left her arms bare. "I must go home to
grandfather now," she said, "but tomorrow I shall come
again. Good-night, Grandmother."</p>

<p>"Yes, come again, be sure you come again tomorrow,"
begged the grandmother, as she pressed Heidi's hands in
hers, unwilling to let her go.</p>

<p>"Why have you taken off that pretty dress," asked
Brigitta.</p>

<p>"Because I would rather go home to grandfather as I
am, or else perhaps he would not know me; you hardly did at
first."</p>

<p>Brigitta went with her to the door, and there said in
rather a mysterious voice, "You must be careful, for Peter
tells me that Alm-Uncle is always now in a bad temper and
never speaks."</p>

<p>Heidi bid her good-night and continued her way up the
mountain, her basket on her arm.</p>

<p>Soon she caught sight of the tops of the fir trees above the
hut roof, then the roof itself, and at last the whole hut, and
there was grandfather sitting as in old days smoking his pipe,
and she could see the fir trees waving in the wind. Quicker
and quicker went her little feet, and before Alm-Uncle had
time to see who was coming, Heidi had rushed up to him,
thrown down her basket and flung her arms round his neck,
unable in the excitement of seeing him again to say more than
"Grandfather! Grandfather! Grandfather!" over and over
again.</p>

<p>And the old man himself said nothing. For the first time
for many years his eyes were wet, and he had to pass his hand
across them. Then he unloosed Heidi's arms, put her on his
knee, and after looking at her for a moment, "So you have
come back to me, Heidi," he said, "how is that? You don't
look much of a grand lady. Did they send you away?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, Grandfather," said Heidi eagerly, "you must
not think that; they were all so kind&mdash;Clara, and grandmamma,
and Mr. Sesemann. But you see, Grandfather, I used
to think I should die, for I felt as if I could not breathe; but
I never said anything because it would have been ungrateful.
And then suddenly one morning quite early Mr. Sesemann
said to me&mdash;but I think it was partly the doctor's doing&mdash;but
perhaps it's all in the letter&mdash;" and Heidi jumped down and
fetched the roll and the letter and handed them both to her
grandfather.</p>

<p>"That belongs to you," he said, laying the roll of money
down on the bench beside him. Then he opened the letter,
read it through, and without a word put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can still drink milk with me, Heidi?"
he asked, taking the child by the hand to go into the hut.
"But bring your money with you; you can buy a bed and bedclothes
and dresses for a couple of years with it."</p>

<p>"I am sure I do not want it," replied Heidi. "I have
got a bed already, and Clara has put such a lot of clothes in
my trunk that I shall never want any more."</p>

<p>"Take it and put it in the cupboard; you will want it some
day I have no doubt."</p>

<p>Heidi obeyed and skipped happily after her grandfather
into the house; she ran into all the corners, delighted to see
everything again, and then went up the ladder&mdash;but there
she came to a pause and called down in a tone of surprise and
distress, "Oh, Grandfather, my bed's gone."</p>

<p>"We can soon make it up again," he answered her from
below. "I did not know that you were coming back; come
along now and have your milk."</p>

<p>Heidi came down, sat herself on her high stool in the old
place, and then taking up her bowl drank her milk eagerly,
as if she had never come across anything so delicious, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>
she put down her bowl, she exclaimed, "Our milk tastes nicer
than anything else in the world, Grandfather."</p>

<p>A shrill whistle was heard outside. Heidi darted out like
a flash of lightning. There were the goats leaping and springing
down the rocks, with Peter in their midst. When he
caught sight of Heidi he stood still with astonishment and
gazed speechlessly at her. Heidi called out, "Good-evening,
Peter," and then ran in among the goats. "Little Swan! Little
Bear! do you know me again?" And the animals evidently
recognized her voice at once, for they began rubbing their
heads against her and bleating loudly as if for joy, and as she
called the other goats by name one after the other, they all
came scampering towards her helter-skelter and crowding
round her. The impatient Greenfinch sprang into the air and
over two of her companions in order to get nearer, and even
the shy little Snowflake butted the Great Turk out of her way
in quite a determined manner, which left him standing taken
aback by her boldness, and lifting his beard in the air as much
as to say, You see who I am.</p>

<p>"So you are back again?" said Peter, at last, taking
Heidi's hand which she was holding out to him in greeting.
"I am glad you are back," he said, while his whole face
beamed with pleasure, and then he prepared to go on with
his goats; but he never had so much trouble with them before,
for when at last, by coaxing and threats, he had got
them all together, and Heidi had gone off with an arm over
either head of her grandfather's two goats the whole flock
suddenly turned and ran after her. Heidi had to go inside
the stall with her two and shut the door, or Peter would
never have got home that night. When she went indoors
after this she found her bed already made up for her. The
grandfather had carefully spread and tucked in the clean
sheets over the fragrant new mown hay. It was with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span>
happy heart that Heidi lay down in it that night, and her
sleep was sounder than it had been for a whole year past.
The grandfather got up at least ten times during the night and
mounted the ladder to see if Heidi was all right and showing
no signs of restlessness, and to feel that the hay he had stuffed
into the round window was keeping the moon from shining too
brightly upon her. But Heidi did not stir; she had no need
now to wander about, for the great burning longing of her
heart was satisfied; she was at home again on the mountain.</p>

<small>THE COAT WITH THE SILVER BUTTONS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> next afternoon Heidi was standing under the waving
trees waiting for her grandfather, who was going down
with her to grandmother's, and then on to Doerfli to fetch her
trunk. She was longing to know how grandmother had enjoyed
her white bread and impatient to see and hear her again.
The grandfather came out, gave a look round, and then called
to her in a cheerful voice, "Well, now we can be off."</p>

<p>It was Saturday, a day when Alm-Uncle made everything
clean and tidy inside and outside the house; he had devoted the
morning to this work so as to be able to accompany Heidi in
the afternoon, and the whole place was now as spick and span
as he liked to see it. They parted at the grandmother's cottage
and Heidi ran in. The grandmother had heard her steps
approaching and greeted her as she crossed the threshold,
"Is it you, child? have you come again?"</p>

<p>Then she took hold of Heidi's hand and held it fast in her
own, for she still seemed to fear that the child might be torn
from her again. She told Heidi how much she had enjoyed the
white bread, and how much stronger she felt already for having
been able to eat it, and then Peter's mother went on and
said she was sure that if her mother could eat like that for a
week she would get back some of her strength.</p>

<p>"I know, Grandmother, what I will do," said Heidi eagerly,
"I will write to Clara, and she will send me as many
rolls again, if not twice as many as you have already, for I had
ever such a large heap in the wardrobe, and when they were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span>
taken away she promised to give me as many back, and she
would do so I am sure."</p>

<p>"That is a good idea," said Brigitta; "but then, they
would get hard and stale. The baker in Doerfli makes the
white rolls, and if we could get some of those&mdash;but I can only
just manage to pay for the black bread."</p>

<p>A further bright thought came to Heidi, and with a look
of joy, "Oh, I have lots of money, Grandmother," she cried
gleefully, skipping about the room in her delight, "and I
know now what I will do with it. You must have a fresh white
roll every day, and two on Sunday, and Peter can bring them
up from Doerfli."</p>

<p>"No, no, child!" answered the grandmother, "I cannot
let you do that; the money was not given to you for that purpose;
you must give it to your grandfather, and he will tell you
how you are to spend it."</p>

<p>But Heidi was not to be hindered in her kind intentions,
and she continued to jump about, saying over and over again
in a tone of exultation, "Now, grandmother can have a roll
every day and will grow quite strong again&mdash;and, Oh, Grandmother,"
she suddenly exclaimed, "if you get strong everything
will grow light again for you; perhaps it's only because
you are weak that it is dark." The grandmother said nothing,
she did not wish to spoil the child's pleasure. As she went
jumping about Heidi suddenly caught sight of the grandmother's
song book, and another happy idea struck her,
"Grandmother, I can also read now, would you like me to
read you one of your hymns from your old book?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said the grandmother, surprised and delighted;
"but can you really read, child, really?"</p>

<p>Heidi climbed on a chair and lifted down the book, bringing
a cloud of dust with it, for it had lain untouched on the
shelf for a long time. She wiped it off and sat herself down on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span>
a stool beside the old woman, and asked her which hymn she
should read.</p>

<p>"What you like, child, what you like," and the grandmother
pushed her spinning-wheel aside and sat in eager expectation
waiting for Heidi to begin. "Here is one about the
sun, Grandmother, I will read you that." And Heidi began,
reading with more and more warmth of expression as she
went on,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The grandmother sat with folded hands and a look of indescribable
joy on her face, such as Heidi had never seen there
before, although at the same time the tears were running
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Ah, Heidi, that brings light to the heart! What comfort
you have brought me!" And the old woman kept on repeating
the glad words, while Heidi beamed with happiness.</p>

<p>Some one now knocked at the window and Heidi looked
up and saw her grandfather beckoning her to come home with
him. She promised the grandmother before leaving her that
she would be with her the next day, and even if she went out
with Peter she would only spend half the day with him, for the
thought that she might make it light and happy again for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span>
grandmother gave her the greatest pleasure, greater even
than being out on the sunny mountain with the flowers and
goats. Heidi was so full of her morning's doings that she began
at once to tell her grandfather all about them: how the
white bread could be brought every day from Doerfli if there
was money for it, and how the grandmother had all at once
grown stronger and happier, and light had come to her. "If
the grandmother won't take the money, Grandfather, will you
give it all to me, and I can then give Peter enough every day
to buy a roll and two on Sunday?"</p>

<p>"But how about the bed?" said her grandfather. "It
would be nice for you to have a proper bed, and there would
then be plenty for the bread."</p>

<p>But Heidi gave her grandfather no peace till he consented
to do what she wanted; she slept a great deal better, she said,
on her bed of hay than on her fine pillowed bed in Frankfurt.
So at last he said, "The money is yours, do what you like with
it; you can buy bread for grandmother for years to come with
it."</p>

<p>Heidi shouted for joy at the thought that grandmother
would never need to eat hard black bread any more, and "Oh,
Grandfather!" she said, "everything is happier now than it
has ever been in our lives before!" and she sang and skipped
along, holding her grandfather's hand as light-hearted as a
bird. But all at once she grew quiet and said, "If God had let
me come at once, as I prayed, then everything would have
been different, I should only have had a little bread to bring
to grandmother, and I should not have been able to read, which
is such a comfort to her. So we will pray every day, won't
we, Grandfather, and never forgot Him again, or else He may
forget us."</p>

<p>"And supposing one does forget Him?" said the grandfather
in a low voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span></p>

<p>"Then everything goes wrong, for God lets us then go
where we like, and when we get poor and miserable and
begin to cry about it no one pities us, but they say, You ran
away from God, and so God, who could have helped you, left
you to yourself."</p>

<p>"That is true, Heidi; where did you learn that?"</p>

<p>"From Grandmamma Sesemann; she explained it all to
me."</p>

<p>The grandfather walked on for a little while without
speaking, then he said, as if following his own train of
thought: "And if it once is so, it is so always; no one can go
back, and he whom God has forgotten, is forgotten for ever."</p>

<p>"Oh, no Grandfather, we can go back, for grandmamma
told me so, and so it was in the beautiful tale in my book&mdash;but
you have not heard that yet; but we shall be home directly
now and then I will read it you, and you will see how beautiful
it is." And in her eagerness Heidi struggled faster and
faster up the steep ascent, and they were no sooner at the top
than she let go her grandfather's hand and ran into the hut.
The grandfather slung the basket off his shoulders in which
he had brought up a part of the contents of the trunk, which
was too heavy to carry up as it was. Then he sat down on
his seat and began thinking.</p>

<p>Heidi soon came running out with her book under her
arm and in a sympathetic voice began to read the story of the
Prodigal Son.</p>

<p>"Isn't that a beautiful tale, Grandfather," said Heidi,
as the latter continued to sit without speaking, for she had expected
him to express pleasure and astonishment.</p>

<p>"You are right, Heidi; it is a beautiful tale," he replied,
but he looked so grave as he said it that Heidi grew silent herself
and sat looking quietly at her pictures.</p>

<p>A few hours later, as she lay fast asleep in her bed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>
grandfather went up the ladder and put his lamp down near
her bed so that the light fell on the sleeping child. Her hands
were still folded as if she had fallen asleep saying her prayers,
an expression of peace and trust lay on the little face, and
something in it seemed to appeal to the grandfather, for he
stood a long time gazing down at her without speaking. At
last he too folded his hands, and with bowed head said in a low
voice, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before Thee
and am not worthy to be called Thy son." And two large
tears rolled down the old man's cheeks.</p>

<p>Next morning while the sound of a few early bells was
ringing up from the valley the grandfather called to Heidi to
put on her best frock for they were going to church together.</p>

<p>She was not long getting ready for it was an unusual summons
from her grandfather. She put on her smart Frankfurt
dress and soon went down, but when she saw her grandfather
she stood still, gazing at him in astonishment. "Why, Grandfather!"
she exclaimed, "I never saw you look like that before!
and the coat, with the silver buttons! Oh, you do look
nice in your Sunday coat!"</p>

<p>The old man smiled and replied, "And you too; now come
along!" He took Heidi's hand and together they walked
down the mountain side. The bells were ringing in every direction
now, sounding louder and fuller as they neared the
valley, and Heidi listened to them with delight. "Hark,
Grandfather! it's like a great festival!"</p>

<p>The congregation had already assembled and the singing
had begun when Heidi and her grandfather entered the church
at Doerfli and sat down at the back. But before the hymn
was over every one was nudging his neighbor and whispering,
"Do you see? Alm-Uncle is in church!"</p>

<p>Soon everybody in the church knew of Alm-Uncle's presence,
and the women kept on turning round to look and quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span>
lost their place in the singing. At the close of the service
Alm-Uncle took Heidi by the hand, and on leaving the church
made his way towards the pastor's house; the rest of the congregation
looked curiously after him, some even following to
see whether he went inside the pastor's house, which he did.
Then they collected in groups and talked over this strange
event, keeping their eyes on the pastor's door, watching to
see whether Alm-Uncle came out looking angry and quarrelsome,
or as if the interview had been a peaceful one, for they
could not imagine what had brought the old man down, and
what it all meant. Some, however, adopted a new tone and
expressed their opinion that Alm-Uncle was not so bad after
all as they thought, "for see how carefully he took the little
one by the hand." And others responded and said they had
always thought people had exaggerated about him, that if he
was so downright bad he would be afraid to go inside the
pastor's house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Alm-Uncle had gone into the pastor's house
and knocked at the study door. The pastor came out and shook
hands warmly with him, and Alm-Uncle was unable at first
to speak, for he had not expected such a friendly reception.
At last he collected himself and said, "I have come to ask you,
pastor, to forget the words I spoke to you when you called on
me, and to beg you not to owe me ill-will for having been so
obstinately set against your well-meant advice. You were
right, and I was wrong, but I have now made up my mind to
follow your advice and to find a place for myself at Doerfli for
the winter, for the child is not strong enough to stand the bitter
cold up on the mountain. And if the people down here
look askance at me, as at a person not to be trusted, I know it
is my own fault."</p>

<p>The pastor's kindly eyes shone with pleasure. He pressed
the old man's hand in his, and said with emotion, "Neighbor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>
I am greatly rejoiced. You will not repent coming to live with
us again; as for myself you will always be welcome as a dear
friend and neighbor, and I look forward to our spending many
a pleasant winter evening together and we will find some nice
friends too for the little one." And the pastor laid his hand
kindly on the child's curly head and took her by the hand as
he walked to the door with the old man. He did not say good-bye
to him till they were standing outside, so that all the people
loitering about saw him shake hands as if parting reluctantly
from his best friend. The door had hardly shut behind
him before the whole congregation now came forward to greet
Alm-Uncle, every one striving to be the first to shake hands
with him. Most of his friends accompanied him and Heidi
some way up the mountain, and each as they bid him good-bye
made him promise that when he next came down he would
without fail come and call. As the old man at last stood alone
with the child, watching their retreating figures, there was a
light upon his face as if reflected from some inner sunshine of
heart. Heidi looking up at him with her clear, steady eyes,
said, "Grandfather, you look nicer and nicer today, I never
saw you quite like that before."</p>

<p>"Do you think so," he answered with a smile. "Well,
yes, Heidi, I am happier today than I deserve, happier than I
had thought possible; it is good to be at peace with God and
man! God was good to me when he sent you to my hut."</p>

<p>When they reached Peter's home the grandfather opened
the door and walked straight in. "Good-morning, Grandmother,"
he said, "I think we shall have to do some more
patching up before the autumn winds come."</p>

<p>"Well, if it is not Uncle!" cried the grandmother in
pleased surprise. "That I should live to see such a thing! and
now I can thank you for all that you have done for me. May
God reward you! may God reward you!" She stretched out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span>
a trembling hand to him, and the grandfather shook it
warmly.</p>

<p>At this moment Peter rushed in, evidently in a great
hurry, knocking his head violently against the door in his
haste, so that everything in the room rattled. Gasping and
breathless he stood still after this and held out a letter. This
was another great event, for such a thing had never happened
before; the letter was addressed to Heidi and had been delivered
at the post-office in Doerfli. They all sat down round
the table to hear what was in it, for Heidi opened it at once
and read it without hesitation. The letter was from Clara,
who wrote that the house had been so dull since Heidi left that
she did not know what to do, and she had at last persuaded
her father to take her to the baths at Ragatz in the coming
autumn; grandmamma had arranged to join them there, and
they both were looking forward to paying her and her grandfather
a visit. And grandmamma sent a further message to
Heidi which was that the latter had done quite right to take
the rolls to the grandmother, and so that she might not have
to eat them dry, she was sending some coffee, which was already
on its way, and grandmamma hoped when she came to
the Alm in the autumn that Heidi would take her to see her
old friend.</p>

<p>There were exclamations of pleasure and astonishment
on hearing this news and the afternoon soon passed in discussing
plans for the coming visit.</p>

<p>Then the old man and Heidi started back up the mountain,
promising the grandmother that they would come again
next day. As they had been greeted with the bells when they
made their journey down in the morning, so now they were
accompanied by the peaceful evening chimes as they climbed
to the hut, which had quite a Sunday-like appearance as it
stood bathed in the light of the low evening sun.</p>

<small>A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">W<span class="smcap">hen</span> Autumn came Clara was not so well and the doctor
advised Mr. Sesemann to postpone the visit to Heidi
till the following spring.</p>

<p>"I know how you hate to deny your child anything and especially
this trip that she has so set her heart upon," said the
kind-hearted old doctor, "but you must make up your mind
to it, Sesemann. Clara has not had such a bad summer as
this last one, for years. Only the worst results would follow
from the fatigue of such a journey, and it is out of the question
for her. If we want to give the child a chance of recovery
we must use the utmost care and watchfulness."</p>

<p>Mr. Sesemann, who had listened to the doctor in sad and
submissive silence, now suddenly jumped up. "Doctor," he
said, "tell me truly: have you really any hope for her final recovery?"</p>

<p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders. "Very little," he replied
quietly. "But, friend, think of my trouble. You still
have a beloved child to look for you and greet you on your
return home. You do not come back to an empty house and sit
down to a solitary meal."</p>

<p>The once bright and cheery doctor was now a broken-hearted
man. He could not get over the loss of his daughter
who had died some months before, and who had been his sole
and constant companion for many years.</p>

<p>Mr. Sesemann, who had been striding up and down the
room, suddenly paused beside his friend and laying his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>
on his shoulder said: "Doctor, I have an idea. How would
it be for you to go, and pay Heidi a visit in our name? You
need a change of scene. I cannot bear to see you so sad; you
are no longer the same man."</p>

<p>The doctor was taken aback at this sudden proposal and
wanted to make objections, but his friend gave him no time to
say anything. He was so delighted with his idea, that he
seized the doctor by the arm and drew him into Clara's room.
She held out her hand to him as he came up to her; he took a
seat beside her, and her father also drew up his chair, and
taking Clara's hand in his began to talk to her of the Swiss
journey and how he himself had looked forward to it. He
passed as quickly as he could over the main point that it was
now impossible for her to undertake it, for he dreaded the
tears that would follow; but he went on without pause to tell
her of his new plan, and dwelt on the great benefit it would be
to his friend if he could be persuaded to take this holiday.</p>

<p>The tears were indeed swimming in the blue eyes, although
Clara struggled to keep them down for her father's
sake, but it was a bitter disappointment to give up the
journey, the thought of which had been her only joy and
solace during the lonely hours of her long illness. She knew,
however, that her father would never refuse her a thing unless
he was certain that it would be harmful for her. So she
swallowed her tears as well as she could and turned her
thoughts to the one hope still left her. Taking the doctor's
hand and stroking it, she said pleadingly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear doctor, you will go and see Heidi, won't you? and
then you can come and tell me all about it, what it is like up
there, and what Heidi and the grandfather, and Peter and
the goats do all day. I know them all so well! And then you
can take what I want to send to Heidi; I have thought about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>
it all, and also something for the grandmother. Do pray go,
dear doctor, and I will take as much cod liver oil as you like."</p>

<p>Whether this promise finally decided the doctor it is impossible
to say, but it is certain that he smiled and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then I must certainly go, Clara, for you will then get as
plump and strong as your father and I wish to see you. And
have you decided when I am to start?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow morning&mdash;early if possible," replied Clara.</p>

<p>"Yes, she is right," put in Mr. Sesemann, "the sun is
shining and the sky is blue, and there is no time to be lost; it
is a pity to miss a single one of these days on the mountain."</p>

<p>The doctor could not help laughing. "You will be reproaching
me next for not being there already; well I must go
and make arrangements for getting off."</p>

<p>But Clara would not let him go until she had given him
endless messages for Heidi, and had explained all he was to
look at so as to give her an exact description on his return.
She would pack the presents she had already bought, and send
them to his house later.</p>

<p>The doctor promised to obey Clara's directions in every
particular; he would start some time during the following day
if not the first thing in the morning, and would bring back a
faithful account of his experiences and of all he saw and
heard.</p>

<p>He was hastening off when he met Miss Rottermeyer just
returning from a walk. He informed her of his intended
journey, begging her in his most conciliatory voice to pack up
the parcels for Heidi as she alone knew how to pack. And
then he took his leave.</p>

<p>Clara quite expected to have a long tussle with Miss Rottermeyer
before she would get the latter to consent to sending
all the things that she had collected as presents for Heidi.
But this time she was mistaken, for Miss Rottermeyer was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>
a more than usually good temper. She cleared the large table
so that all the things for Heidi could be spread out upon it and
packed under Clara's own eyes. It was no light job, for the
presents were of all shapes and sizes. First there was the
little warm cloak with a hood, which had been designed by
Clara herself, in order that Heidi during the coming winter
might be able to go and see grandmother when she liked, and
not have to wait till her grandfather could take her wrapped
up in a sack to keep her from freezing. Then came a thick
warm shawl for the grandmother, in which she could wrap
herself well up and not feel the cold when the wind came
sweeping in such terrible gusts round the house. The next
object was the large box full of cakes; these were also for the
grandmother, that she might have something to eat with her
coffee besides bread. An immense sausage was the next
article; this had been originally intended for Peter, who never
had anything but bread and cheese, but Clara had altered her
mind, fearing that in his delight he might eat it all up at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>
and make himself ill. So she arranged to send it to Brigitta,
who could take some for herself and the grandmother and
give Peter his portion out by degrees. A packet of tobacco
was a present for grandfather, who was so fond of his pipe as
he sat resting in the evening. Finally there was a whole lot
of mysterious little bags, and parcels, and boxes, which Clara
had had especial pleasure in collecting, as each was to be a
joyful surprise for Heidi as she opened it. The work came to
an end at last, and Clara eyed the big box with pleasure,
picturing Heidi's exclamations and jumps of joy and surprise
when the huge parcel arrived at the hut.</p>


<p>Sebastian came in, and lifting the package on to his
shoulder, carried it off to be forwarded at once to the doctor's
house.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="ChXVI." id="ChXVI."></a>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<small>THE DOCTOR COMES WITH PRESENTS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> early light of morning lay rosy red upon the mountains,
and a fresh breeze rustled through the fir trees and
set their ancient branches waving to and fro. The sound
awoke Heidi and she jumped out of bed and dressed herself as
quickly as she could.</p>

<p>When she went down her ladder she found her grandfather
had already left the hut. He was standing outside
looking at the sky and examining the landscape as he did
every morning, to see what sort of weather it was going to be.</p>

<p>Little pink clouds were floating over the sky, that was
growing brighter and bluer with every minute, while the
heights and the meadow lands were turning gold under the
rising sun, which was just appearing above the topmost
peaks.</p>

<p>"O, how beautiful! how beautiful! Good-morning, Grandfather!"
cried Heidi, running out.</p>

<p>"What, you are awake already, are you?" he answered,
giving her a morning greeting.</p>

<p>Then Heidi ran round to the fir trees to enjoy the sound
she loved so well, and with every fresh gust of wind which
came roaring through their branches she gave a fresh jump
and cry of delight.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the grandfather had gone to milk the goats;
this done he brushed and washed them, ready for their mountain
excursion, and brought them out of their shed. As soon as
Heidi caught sight of them she ran and embraced them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span>
they bleated in return, while they vied with each other in
showing their affection by poking their heads against her and
trying which could get nearest her. When the lively Little
Bear gave rather too violent a thrust, she only said, "No, Little
Bear, you are pushing like the Great Turk," and Little
Bear immediately drew back his head and left off his rough
attentions, while Little Swan lifted her head and put on an
expression as much as to say, "No one shall ever accuse me of
behaving like the Great Turk."</p>

<p>Peter's whistle was heard and all the goats came along,
leaping and springing, and Heidi soon found herself surrounded
by the whole flock, pushed this way and that by their
obstreperous greetings, but at last she managed to get through
them to where Snowflake was standing, for the young goat
had in vain striven to reach her.</p>

<p>Peter now gave a last tremendous whistle, in order to
startle the goats and drive them off, for he wanted to get near
himself to say something to Heidi. The goats sprang aside
and he came up to her.</p>

<p>"Can you come out with me today?" he asked, evidently
unwilling to hear her refuse.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I cannot, Peter," she answered. "I am expecting
them every minute from Frankfurt, and I must be at
home when they come."</p>

<p>"You have said the same thing for days now," grumbled
Peter.</p>

<p>"I must continue to say it till they come," replied Heidi.
"How can you think, Peter, that I would be away when they
came? As if I could do such a thing?"</p>

<p>"They would find Uncle at home," he answered with a
snarling voice.</p>

<p>But at this moment the grandfather's stentorian voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span>
was heard. "Why is the army not marching forward? Is it
the field-marshal who is missing or some of the troops?"</p>

<p>Whereupon Peter turned and went off, swinging his stick
round so that it whistled through the air, and the goats, who
understood the signal, started at full trot for their mountain
pasture, Peter following in their wake.</p>

<p>Since Heidi had come back to her grandfather she had
learned to do many things about the house. She put her bed
in order every morning, patting and stroking it till she had
got it perfectly smooth and flat. Then she went about the
room downstairs, put each chair back in its place, and if she
found anything lying about she put it in the cupboard. After
that she fetched a duster, climbed on a chair, and rubbed the
table till it shone again. When the grandfather came in later
he would look round well pleased and say to himself, "We look
like Sunday every day now; Heidi did not go abroad for
nothing."</p>

<p>After Peter had departed and she and her grandfather
had breakfasted, Heidi began her daily work as usual, but she
did not get on with it very fast. It was so lovely out of doors
today, and every minute something happened to interrupt
her in her work. Now it was a bright beam of sun shining
cheerfully through the open window, and seeming to say,
"Come out, Heidi, come out!" Heidi felt she could not stay indoors,
and she ran out in answer to the call. The sunlight lay
sparkling on everything around the hut and on all the mountains
and far away along the valley, and the grass slope looked
so golden and inviting that she was obliged to sit down for a
few minutes and look about her. Then she suddenly remembered
that her stool was left standing in the middle of the
floor and that the table had not been rubbed, and she jumped
up and ran inside again. But it was not long before the fir
trees began their old song; Heidi felt it in all her limbs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>
again the desire to run outside was irresistible, and she was
off to play and leap to the tune of the waving branches. The
grandfather, who was busy in his work-shed, stepped out
from time to time smiling to watch her at her gambols. He
had just gone back to his work on one of these occasions when
Heidi called out, "Grandfather! Grandfather! Come, come!"</p>

<p>He stepped quickly out, almost afraid something had happened
to the child, but he saw her running towards where the
mountain path descended, crying, "They are coming! they are
coming! and the doctor is in front of them!"</p>

<p>Heidi rushed forward to welcome her old friend, who
held out his hands in greeting to her. When she came up to
him she clung to his outstretched arm, and exclaimed in the
joy of her heart, "Good-morning, doctor, and thank you ever
so many times."</p>

<p>"God bless you, child! what have you got to thank me
for?" asked the doctor, smiling.</p>

<p>"For being at home again with grandfather," the child
explained.</p>

<p>The doctor's face brightened as if a sudden ray of sunshine
had passed across it; he had not expected such a reception
as this. He had quite thought that Heidi would have
forgotten him; she had seen so little of him, and he had felt
rather like one bearing a message of disappointment. But instead,
here was Heidi, her eyes dancing for joy, and full of
gratitude and affection, clinging to the arm of her kind
friend.</p>

<p>He took her by the hand with fatherly tenderness. "Take
me now to your grandfather, Heidi, and show me where you
live."</p>

<p>But Heidi still remained standing looking down the path
with a questioning gaze. "Where are Clara and grandmother?"
she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, now I have to tell you something which you will be
as sorry about as I am," answered the doctor. "You see,
Heidi, I have come alone. Clara was very ill and could not
travel, and so the grandmother stayed behind too. But next
spring, when the days grow warm and long again, they are
coming here for certain."</p>

<p>Heidi stood motionless for a second or two, overcome by
the unexpected disappointment. She suddenly remembered
that the doctor had really come anyway. She lifted her eyes
and saw the sad expression in his as he looked down at her;
she had never seen him with that look on his face when she
was in Frankfurt. It went to Heidi's heart; she could not bear
to see anybody unhappy, especially her dear doctor. No
doubt it was because Clara and grandmother could not come,
and so she began to think how best she might console him.</p>

<p>"Oh, it won't be very long to wait for spring, and then
they will be sure to come," she said in a reassuring voice.
"Time passes very quickly with us, and then they will be able
to stay longer when they are here, and Clara will be pleased at
that. Now let us go and find grandfather."</p>

<p>Hand in hand with her friend she climbed up to the hut.
She was so anxious to make the doctor happy again that she
began once more assuring him that the winter passed quickly
on the mountain and that summer would be back again before
they knew it, and she became so convinced of the truth of her
own words that she called out quite cheerfully to her grandfather
as they approached, "They have not come today, but
they will be here in a very short time."</p>


<p>The doctor was no stranger to the grandfather, for the
child had talked to him so much about her friend. The old
man held out his hand to his guest in friendly greeting. Then
the two men sat down in front of the hut. The doctor
whispered to Heidi that there was something being brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span>
up the mountain which had traveled with him from Frankfurt,
and which would give her even more pleasure than seeing
him. Heidi got into a great state of excitement on hearing
this, wondering what it could be. The old man urged the
doctor to spend as many of the beautiful autumn days on the
mountain as he could, and at least to come up whenever it was
fine; he could not offer him a lodging, as he had no place to put
him; he advised the doctor, however, not to go back to Ragatz,
but to stay at Doerfli, where there was a clean, tidy little inn.
Then the doctor could come up every morning, which would
do him no end of good, and if he liked, he, the grandfather,
would act as his guide to any part of the mountains he would
like to see. The doctor was delighted with this proposal, and
it was settled that it should be as the grandfather suggested.</p>

<p>Alm-Uncle now rose and went indoors, returning in a few
minutes with a table which he placed in front of the seat.</p>

<p>"There, Heidi, now run in and bring us what we want for
the table," he said. "The doctor must take us as he finds us;
if the food is plain, he will acknowledge that the dining-room
is pleasant."</p>

<p>"I should think so indeed," replied the doctor as he
looked down over the sun-lit valley, "and I accept the kind
invitation; everything must taste good up here."</p>

<p>Heidi ran backwards and forwards as busy as a bee and
brought out everything she could find in the cupboard. The
grandfather meanwhile had been preparing the meal, and now
appeared with a steaming jug of milk and golden-brown
toasted cheese. Then he cut some thin slices from the meat he
had cured himself in the pure air, and the doctor enjoyed his
dinner better than he had for a whole year past.</p>

<p>"Our Clara must certainly come up here," he said, "it
would make her quite a different person, and if she could eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span>
for any length of time as I have today, she would grow plumper
than any one has ever known her before."</p>

<p>As he spoke a man was seen coming up the path carrying
a large package on his back. When he reached the hut he
threw it on the ground and drew in two or three good breaths
of the mountain air.</p>

<p>"Ah, here's what travelled with me from Frankfurt,"
said the doctor, rising, and he went up to the package and
began undoing it, Heidi looking on in great expectation. After
he had released it from its heavy outer covering, "There,
child," he said, "now you can go on unpacking your treasures
yourself."</p>

<p>Heidi undid her presents one by one until they were all
displayed; she could not speak for wonder and delight. Not
till the doctor opened the large box to show Heidi the cakes
that were for the grandmother to eat with her coffee, did she
at last give a cry of joy, exclaiming, "Now grandmother will
have nice things to eat," and she wanted to pack everything
up again and start at once to give them to her. But the grandfather
said he should walk down with the doctor that evening
and she could go with them and take the things. Heidi next
found the packet of tobacco which she ran and gave to her
grandfather; he was so pleased with it that he immediately
filled his pipe with some, and the two men then sat down together
again, the smoke curling up from their pipes as they
talked of all kinds of things, while Heidi continued to examine
first one and then another of her presents. Suddenly she ran
up to them, and standing in front of the doctor waited till
there was a pause in the conversation, and then said, "No, the
presents have not given me more pleasure than seeing you,
doctor."</p>

<p>The two men could not help laughing, and the doctor
answered that he should never have thought it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span></p>

<p>As the sun began to sink behind the mountains the doctor
rose, thinking it time to return to Doerfli and seek for quarters.
The grandfather carried the cakes and the shawl and
the large sausage, and the doctor took Heidi's hand, as they
all three started down the mountain. Arrived at Peter's home
Heidi bid the others good-bye; she was to wait at grandmother's
till her grandfather, who was going on to Doerfli
with his guest, returned for her. As the doctor shook hands
with her she asked, "Would you like to come out with the
goats tomorrow morning?" for she could think of no greater
treat to offer him.</p>

<p>"Agreed!" answered the doctor, "we will go together."</p>

<p>Heidi now ran in to the grandmother: she first, with some
effort, managed to carry in the box of cakes; then she ran out
again and brought in the sausage&mdash;for her grandfather had
put the presents down by the door&mdash;and then a third time for
the shawl. She placed them as close as she could to the grandmother,
so that the latter might be able to feel them and understand
what was there. The shawl she laid over the old
woman's knees.</p>

<p>"They are all from Frankfurt, from Clara and grandmamma,"
she explained to the astonished grandmother and
Brigitta, the latter having watched her dragging in all the
heavy things unable to imagine what was happening.</p>

<p>"And you are very pleased with the cakes, aren't you,
Grandmother? taste how soft they are!" said Heidi over and
over again, to which the grandmother continued to answer,
"Yes, yes, Heidi, I should think so! what kind people they
must be!" And then she would pass her hand over the warm,
thick shawl and add, "This will be beautiful for the cold
winter! I never thought I should ever have such a splendid
thing as this to put on."</p>

<p>Heidi could not help feeling some surprise at the grandmother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span>
seeming to take more pleasure in the shawl than the
cakes. Meanwhile Brigitta stood gazing at the sausage with
almost an expression of awe. She had hardly in her life seen
such a monster sausage, much less owned one, and she could
scarcely believe her eyes.</p>

<p>Peter came tumbling in at this minute. "Uncle is just
behind me, he is coming&mdash;" he began, and then stopped short,
for his eye had caught sight of the sausage, and he was too
much taken aback to say more. But Heidi understood that
her grandfather was near and so said good-bye to grandmother.
The old man now never passed the door without going
in to wish the old woman good-day, and she liked to hear
his footstep approaching, for he always had a cheery word for
her. But today it was growing late for Heidi, who was always
up with the lark, and the grandfather would never let her go
to bed after hours; so this evening he only called good-night
through the open door and started home at once with the
child, and the two climbed under the starlit sky back to their
peaceful dwelling.</p>

<small>EXCURSIONS OVER THE MOUNTAINS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> next morning the doctor climbed up from Doerfli with
Peter and the goats. At the hut, they found Heidi awaiting
them with her two goats, all three as fresh and lively as
the morning sun among the mountains.</p>

<p>"Are you coming today?" said Peter, repeating the
words with which he daily greeted her.</p>

<p>"Of course I am, if the doctor is coming too," replied
Heidi.</p>

<p>Peter cast a sidelong glance at the doctor. The grandfather
now came out with the dinner bag, and after bidding
good-day to the doctor he went up to Peter and slung it over
his neck. It was heavier than usual, for Alm-Uncle had added
some meat today, as he thought the doctor might like to have
his lunch out of doors with the children. Peter gave a grin,
for he felt sure there was something extra good in it.</p>

<p>And so the ascent began. The goats as usual came
thronging round Heidi, each trying to be nearest her, until at
last she stood still and said, "Now you must go on in front and
behave properly, and not keep on turning back and pushing
and poking me, for I want to talk to the doctor." By degrees
she managed to make her way out from among them and
joined the doctor, who took her by the hand. Heidi had a
great deal to say about the goats and their peculiarities, and
about the flowers and the rocks and the birds, and so they
clambered on and reached their resting-place before they
were aware. Peter had sent a good many unfriendly glances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span>
towards the doctor on the way up, which might have quite
alarmed the latter if he had happened to notice them, which,
fortunately, he did not.</p>

<p>Heidi led her friend to her favorite spot where she was
accustomed to sit and enjoy the beauty around her; the doctor
followed her example and took his seat beside her on the warm
grass. The great snowfield sparkled in the bright sunlight,
on the rocky peaks. A soft, light morning breeze blew deliciously
across the mountain, gently stirring the bluebells
that still remained of the summer's wealth of flowers, their
slender heads nodding cheerfully in the sunshine. Overhead
the great bird was flying round and round in wide circles.
Heidi looked about her first at one thing and then at another.
Her eyes were alight with joy. She turned to her friend to
see if he too were enjoying the beauty. The doctor had been
sitting thoughtfully gazing around him. As he met her glad
bright eyes, "Yes, Heidi," he responded, "I see how lovely it
all is, but tell me&mdash;if one brings a sad heart up here, how may
it be healed so that it can rejoice in all this beauty?"</p>

<p>"But no one is sad up here, only in Frankfurt," exclaimed
Heidi.</p>

<p>The doctor smiled, and then growing serious again he
continued, "But supposing one is not able to leave all the sadness
behind at Frankfurt; can you tell me anything that will
help then?"</p>

<p>"When you do not know what more to do you must go
and tell everything to God," answered Heidi with decision.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is a good thought of yours, Heidi," said the
doctor. "But if it is God Himself who has sent the trouble,
what can we say to Him then?"</p>

<p>Heidi sat pondering for a while; she was sure in her heart
that God could help out of every trouble. She thought over
her own experiences and then found her answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span></p>

<p>"Then you must wait," she said, "and keep on saying to
yourself: God certainly knows of some happiness for us
which He is going to bring out of the trouble, only we must
have patience and not run away."</p>

<p>"That is a beautiful faith, child, and be sure you hold
it fast," replied the doctor. "But can you understand, Heidi,
that a man may sit here with such a shadow over his eyes that
he cannot feel and enjoy the beauty around him, while the
heart grows doubly sad knowing how beautiful it could be.
Can you understand that?"</p>

<p>A pain shot through the child's young, happy heart. The
shadow over the eyes brought to her remembrance the grandmother,
who would never again be able to see the sunlight and
the beauty up here. This was Heidi's great sorrow, which reawoke
each time she thought about the darkness.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can understand it. And I know this, that then
one must say one of grandmother's hymns, which bring the
light back a little, and often make it so bright for her that she
is quite happy again. Grandmother herself told me this."</p>

<p>"Which hymns are they, Heidi?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"I only know the one about the sun and the beautiful
garden, and some of the verses of the long one, which are favorites
with her, and she always likes me to read them to her
two or three times over," replied Heidi.</p>

<p>"Well, say the verses to me then, I should like to hear
them too," said the doctor.</p>

<p>Heidi collected her thoughts for a second or two and
began,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let not your heart be troubled<br /></span>

<p>Suddenly she paused; she was not sure if the doctor was
still listening. He was sitting motionless with his hand before
his eyes. His thoughts had carried him back to a long
past time: he saw himself as a little boy standing by his dear
mother's chair; she had her arm round his neck and was saying
the very verses to him that Heidi had just recited&mdash;words
which he had not heard now for years. He could hear his
mother's voice and see her loving eyes resting upon him, and
as Heidi ceased the old dear voice seemed to be saying other
things to him; and the words he heard again must have carried
him far, far away, for it was a long time before he stirred or
took his hand from his eyes. When at last he roused himself
he met Heidi's eyes looking wonderingly at him.</p>

<p>"Heidi," he said, taking the child's hand in his, "that was
a beautiful hymn of yours," and there was a happier ring in
his voice as he spoke. "We will come out here together another
day, and you will let me hear it again."</p>

<p>Peter meanwhile had been giving vent to his anger. It
was now some days since Heidi had been out with him, and
when at last she did come there she sat the whole time beside
the old gentleman, and Peter could not get a word with her.
He got into a terrible temper, and at last went and stood some
way back behind the doctor, where the latter could not see
him, and doubling his fist made imaginary hits at the enemy.
Presently he doubled both fists, and the longer Heidi stayed
beside the gentleman, the more fiercely did he threaten with
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the sun had risen to the height which Peter
knew pointed to the dinner hour. All of a sudden he called
at the top of his voice, "It's dinner time."</p>

<p>Heidi started for the dinner bag so that the doctor might
eat his where he sat. But he stopped her, telling her he was
not hungry at all, and only cared for a glass of milk, as he
wanted to climb up a little higher. Then Heidi found that she
also was not hungry and only wanted milk, and she should
like, she said, to take the doctor up to the large moss-covered
rock where Greenfinch had nearly jumped down and killed
herself. So she ran and explained matters to Peter, telling
him to go and get milk for the two. Peter seemed hardly to
understand. "Who is going to eat what is in the bag, then?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"You can have it," she answered, "only first make haste
and get the milk."</p>

<p>Peter had seldom performed any task more promptly,
for he thought of the bag and its contents, which now belonged
to him. As soon as the other two were sitting quietly
drinking their milk, he opened it, and quite trembled for joy
at the sight of the meat, and he was just putting his hand in to
draw it out when something seemed to hold him back. His
conscience smote him at the remembrance of how he had stood
with his doubled fists behind the doctor, who was giving up
to him his whole good dinner. He felt as if he could not now
enjoy it. But all at once he jumped up and ran back to the
spot where he had stood before, and there held up his open
hands as a sign that he had no longer any wish to use them as
fists, and kept them up until he felt he had made amends for
his past conduct. Then he rushed back and sat down to the
double enjoyment of a clear conscience and unusually satisfying
meal.</p>

<p>Heidi and the doctor climbed and talked for a long while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span>
until the latter said it was time for him to be going back, and
no doubt Heidi would like to go and be with her goats. But
Heidi would not hear of this, as then the doctor would have to
go the whole way down the mountain alone. She insisted on
accompanying him as far as the grandfather's hut, or even a
little further. She kept hold of her friend's hand all the
time, and the whole way she entertained him with accounts of
this thing and that. But at last the doctor insisted on her
going back; so they bid each other good-night and the doctor
continued his descent, turning now and again to look back,
and each time he saw Heidi standing on the same spot and
waving her hand to him. Even so in the old days had his own
dear little daughter watched him when he went from home.</p>


<p>It was a bright, sunny autumn month. The doctor came
up to the hut every morning, and thence made excursions over
the mountain. Alm-Uncle accompanied him on some of his
higher ascents. The doctor found great pleasure in his companion's
conversation, and was astonished at his knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span>
of the plants that grew on the mountain. He was well versed
also in the ways of the animals, great and small, and had many
amusing anecdotes to tell of these dwellers in caves and holes
and in the tops of the fir trees. And so the time passed pleasantly
and quickly for the doctor, who seldom said good-bye
to the old man at the end of the day without adding, "I never
leave you, friend, without having learnt something new from
you."</p>

<p>On some of the very finest days, however, the doctor
would wander out again with Heidi, and then the two would
sit together as on the first day, and the child would repeat her
hymns and tell the doctor things which she alone knew. Peter
sat at a little distance from them, but he was now quite reconciled
in spirit and gave vent to no angry pantomime.</p>

<p>September had drawn to its close, and one morning the
doctor appeared looking less cheerful than usual. It was his
last day, he said, as he must return to Frankfurt, but he was
grieved at having to say good-bye to the mountain, which had
begun to feel quite like home to him. Alm-Uncle, on his side,
greatly regretted the departure of his guest, and Heidi had
been accustomed for so long to see her good friend every day
that she could hardly believe the time had suddenly come to
separate. She walked part way down the mountain with him,
still unable to grasp the idea that he was going for good. After
some distance the doctor stood still, and passing his hand over
the child's curly head said, "Now, Heidi, you must go back,
and I must say good-bye! If only I could take you with me to
Frankfurt and keep you there!"</p>

<p>The picture of Frankfurt rose before the child's eyes, its
endless rows of houses, its hard streets, and even the vision of
Miss Rottermeyer and Tinette, and she answered hesitatingly,
"I would rather that you came back to us."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are right, that would be better. But now good-bye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span>
Heidi." The child put her hand in his and looked up at
him; the kind eyes looking down on her had tears in them.
Then the doctor tore himself away and quickly continued his
descent.</p>

<p>Heidi remained standing without moving. The friendly
eyes with the tears in them had gone to her heart. All at once
she burst into tears and started running as fast as she could
after the departing figure, calling out in broken tones:
"Doctor! doctor!"</p>

<p>He turned round and waited till the child reached him.
The tears were streaming down her face and she sobbed out:
"I will come to Frankfurt with you, now at once, and I will
stay with you as long as you like, only I must just run back
and tell grandfather."</p>

<p>The doctor laid his hand on her and tried to calm her excitement.
"No, no, dear child," he said kindly, "not now;
you must stay for the present under the fir trees, you might
get sick again. But if I am ever ill and alone, will you come
then and stay with me? May I know that there would then
be some one to look after me and care for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I will come the very day you send for me, and
I love you nearly as much as grandfather," replied Heidi, who
had not yet got over her distress.</p>

<p>And so the doctor again bid her good-bye and started on
his way, while Heidi remained looking after him and waving
her hand as long as a speck of him could be seen. As the
doctor turned for the last time and looked back at the waving
Heidi and the sunny mountain, he said to himself, "It is good
to be up there, good for body and soul, and a man might learn
how to be happy once more."</p>

<small>A NEW HOME FOR THE WINTER</small></p>


<p class="drop-cap">A<span class="smcap">lm-Uncle</span> had kept his word and was not spending the
winter in his old home. As soon as the first snow began
to fall, he had shut up the hut and the outside buildings and
gone down to Doerfli with Heidi and the goats. Near the
church was a straggling half-ruined building, which had once
been the home of a distinguished soldier. It was rented to
poor people, who paid but a small sum, and when any part of
the building fell it was allowed to remain. As soon as the
grandfather had made up his mind to spend the winter in
Doerfli, he rented the old place and worked during the autumn
to get it sound and tight. In the middle of October he and
Heidi took up their residence there.</p>

<p>On approaching the house from the back one came first
into an open space with a wall on either side, of which one was
half in ruins. Above this rose the arch of an old window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span>
thickly overgrown with ivy, which spread over the remains
of a domed roof that had evidently been part of a chapel. A
large hall came next, which lay open, without doors, to the
square outside. Here also walls and roof only partially remained,
and indeed what was left of the roof looked as if it
might fall at any minute had it not been for two stout pillars
that supported it. Alm-Uncle had here put up a wooden partition
and covered the floor with straw, for this was to be the
goats' house. Endless passages led from this, through the
rents of which the sky as well as the fields and the road outside
could be seen at intervals; but at last one came to a stout
oak door that led into a room that still stood intact. Here the
walls and the dark wainscoting remained as good as ever, and
in the corner was an immense stove reaching nearly to the
ceiling, on the white tiles of which were painted large pictures
in blue. These represented old castles surrounded with trees,
and huntsmen riding out with their hounds; or else a quiet
lake scene, with broad oak trees and a man fishing. A seat ran
all round the stove so that one could sit at one's ease and study
the pictures. These attracted Heidi's attention at once, and
she had no sooner arrived with her grandfather than she ran
and seated herself and began to examine them. But when
she had gradually worked herself round to the back, something
else diverted her attention. In the large space between
the stove and the wall four planks had been put together as if
to make a large receptacle for apples; there were no apples,
however, inside, but something Heidi had no difficulty in
recognizing, for it was her very own bed, with its hay mattress
and sheets, and sack for a coverlid, just as she had it up at the
hut. Heidi clapped her hands for joy and exclaimed, "O
Grandfather, this is my room, how nice! But where are you
going to sleep?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span></p>

<p>"Your room must be near the stove or you will freeze,"
he replied, "but you can come and see mine too."</p>

<p>Heidi got down and skipped across the large room after
her grandfather, who opened a door at the farther end leading
into a smaller one which was to be his bed-room. Then came
another door. Heidi pushed it open and stood amazed, for
here was an immense room like a kitchen, larger than anything
of the kind that Heidi had seen before. There was still
plenty of work for the grandfather before this room could be
finished, for there were holes and cracks in the walls through
which the wind whistled, and yet he had already nailed up so
many new planks that it looked as if a lot of small cupboards
had been set up round the room. He had, however, made the
large, old door safe with many screws and nails, as a protection
against the outside air, and this was very necessary, for
just beyond was a mass of ruined building overgrown with tall
weeds, which made a dwelling-place for innumerable beetles
and lizards.</p>

<p>Heidi was very delighted with her new home, and by the
morning after their arrival she knew every nook and corner
so thoroughly that she could take Peter over it and show him
all that was to be seen; indeed she would not let him go till he
had examined every single wonderful thing contained in it.</p>

<p>Heidi slept soundly in her corner by the stove; but every
morning when she first awoke she still thought she was on
the mountain, and that she must run outside at once to see if
the fir trees were so quiet because their branches were
weighed down with the thick snow. She had to look about her
for some minutes before she felt quite sure where she was, and
a certain sensation of trouble and oppression would come over
her as she grew aware that she was not at home in the hut. But
then she would hear her grandfather's voice outside, attending
to the goats, and these would give one or two loud bleats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span>
as if calling to her to make haste and go to them, and then
Heidi was happy again, for she knew she was still at home, and
she would jump gladly out of bed and run out to the animals
as quickly as she could. On the fourth morning, as soon as she
saw her grandfather, she said, "I must go up to see grandmother
today; she ought not to be alone so long."</p>

<p>But the grandfather would not agree to this. "Neither
today nor tomorrow can you go," he said, "the mountain is
covered fathom-deep in snow, and the snow is still falling; the
sturdy Peter can hardly get along. A little creature like you
would soon be smothered by it, and we should not be able to
find you again. Wait a bit till it freezes, then you will be able
to walk over the hard snow."</p>

<p>Heidi now went to school in Doerfli and eagerly set to
work to learn all that was taught her. She hardly ever saw
Peter there, for as a rule he was absent. The teacher was an
easy-going man who merely remarked now and then, "Peter
is not turning up today again, it seems, but there is a lot of
snow up on the mountain and I daresay he cannot get along."
Peter, however, always seemed able to make his way through
the snow in the evening when school was over, and he then
generally paid Heidi a visit.</p>

<p>At last, after some days, when Peter climbed out of his
window one morning&mdash;the door was quite blocked by the snow
outside&mdash;he was taken by surprise, for instead of sinking into
the snow he fell on the hard ground and went sliding some
way down the mountain side like a sleigh, before he could stop
himself. He picked himself up and tested the hardness of the
ground by stamping on it and trying with all his might to
dig his heels into it, but even then he could not break off a
single little splinter of ice; the Alm was frozen hard as iron.
This was just what Peter had been hoping for, as he knew
now that Heidi would be able to come up to see them. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span>
quickly got back into the house, swallowed the milk which his
mother had ready for him, thrust a piece of bread in his
pocket, and said, "I must be off to school," and in another
minute was shooting down the mountain on his sled.</p>

<p>He went like lightning, and when he reached Doerfli,
which stood on the direct road to Mayenfeld, he made up his
mind to go on further. So down he still went till he reached
the level ground, where the sled came to a pause of its own
accord, some little way beyond Mayenfeld. He knew it was
too late to get to school now, as lessons would already have
begun, and it would take him a good hour to walk back to
Doerfli. So he took his time about returning, and reached
Doerfli just as Heidi had got home from school and was sitting
at dinner with her grandfather. Peter walked in, exclaiming
as he stood still in the middle of the room, "She's got it now."</p>

<p>"Got it? what?" asked the Uncle. "Your words sound
quite warlike, general."</p>

<p>"The frost," explained Peter.</p>

<p>"Oh! now I can go and see grandmother!" said Heidi joyfully,
for she had understood Peter's words at once. "But
why were you not at school then? You could have come down
on the sled," she added reproachfully, for it did not agree with
Heidi's ideas of good behavior to stay away when it was possible
to be there.</p>

<p>"It carried me on too far and I was too late," Peter replied.</p>

<p>"I call that being a deserter," said the Uncle, "and deserters
get their ears pulled, as you know."</p>

<p>Peter gave a tug to his cap in alarm, for there was no one
of whom he stood in so much awe as Alm-Uncle.</p>

<p>"And an army leader like yourself ought to be doubly
ashamed of running away," continued Alm-Uncle. "What
would you think of your goats if one went off this way and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span>
another that, and refused to follow and do what was good for
them? What would you do then?"</p>

<p>"I should beat them," said Peter promptly.</p>

<p>"And if a boy behaved like these unruly goats, and he
got a beating for it, what would you say then?"</p>

<p>"Serves him right," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Good, then understand this: next time you let your sled
carry you past the school when you ought to be inside at your
lessons, come on to me afterwards and receive what you deserve."</p>

<p>Peter understood the drift of the old man's questions and
that he was the boy who behaved like the unruly goats, and he
looked somewhat fearfully towards the corner to see if there
happened to be a stick around.</p>

<p>But now the grandfather suddenly said in a cheerful
voice, "Come and sit down and have something, and afterwards
Heidi shall go with you. Bring her back this evening
and you will find supper waiting for you here."</p>

<p>This unexpected turn of conversation set Peter grinning
all over with delight. He obeyed without hesitation and took
his seat beside Heidi. But the child could not eat in her excitement
at the thought of going to see grandmother. She ran
to the cupboard and brought out the warm cloak Clara had
sent her; with this on and the hood drawn over her head, she
was all ready for her journey. She stood waiting beside
Peter, and as soon as his last mouthful had disappeared she
said, "Come along now." As the two walked together Heidi
had much to tell Peter of her two goats that had been so unhappy
the first day in their new stall that they would not eat
anything, but stood hanging their heads, not even rousing
themselves to bleat. And when she asked her grandfather
the reason of this, he told her it was the same with the goats
as with her in Frankfurt, for it was the first time in their lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>
they had come down from the mountain. "And you don't
know what that is, Peter, unless you have felt it yourself,"
added Heidi.</p>

<p>When they reached their destination they found Brigitta
sitting alone knitting, for the grandmother was not very well
and had to stay in bed on account of the cold. Heidi had
never before missed the old figure in her place in the corner,
and she ran quickly into the next room. There lay grandmother
on her little, poorly covered bed, wrapped up in her
warm grey shawl.</p>

<p>"Thank God," she exclaimed as Heidi came running in;
the poor old woman had had a secret fear at heart all through
the autumn, especially if Heidi was absent for any length of
time, for Peter had told her of a strange gentleman who had
come from Frankfurt, and who had gone out with them and
always talked to Heidi, and she had felt sure he had come to
take her away again. Even when she heard he had gone off
alone, she still had an idea that a messenger would be sent
over from Frankfurt to take the child. Heidi went up to the
side of the bed and said, "Are you very ill, Grandmother?"</p>

<p>"No, no, child," answered the old woman reassuringly,
passing her hand lovingly over the child's head, "it's only the
frost that has got into my bones a bit."</p>

<p>"Shall you be quite well then directly it turns warm
again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, God willing, or even before that, for I want to get
back to my spinning; I thought perhaps I should do a little today,
but tomorrow I am sure to be all right again."</p>

<p>Heidi noticed that the grandmother was wrapped up in
her nice shawl and exclaimed: "In Frankfurt everybody
puts on a shawl to go out walking; did you think it was to be
worn in bed, Grandmother?"</p>

<p>"I put it on, dear child, to keep myself from freezing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span>
I am so pleased with it, for my bedclothes are not very thick,"
she answered.</p>

<p>"But, Grandmother," continued Heidi, "your bed is not
right, because it goes downhill at your head instead of uphill."</p>

<p>"I know it, child, I can feel it," and the grandmother put
up her hand to the thin, flat pillow, which was little more than
a board under her head, to make herself more comfortable;
"the pillow was never very thick, and I have lain on it now
for so many years that it has grown quite flat."</p>

<p>"Oh, if only I had asked Clara to let me take away my
Frankfurt bed," said Heidi. "I had three large pillows, one
above the other, so that I could hardly sleep, and I used to slip
down to try and find a flat place, and then I had to pull myself
up again, because it was proper to sleep there like that.
Could you sleep like that, grandmother?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! the pillows keep one warm, and it is easier to
breathe when the head is high," answered the grandmother.
"But we will not talk about that, for I have so much that
other old sick people are without for which I thank God; there
is the nice bread I get every day, and this warm wrap, and
your visits, Heidi. Will you read me something today?"</p>

<p>Heidi ran into the next room to get the hymn book. Then
she picked out the favorite hymns one after another, for she
knew them all by heart now, and was as pleased as the grandmother
to hear them again after so many days.</p>

<p>The grandmother lay with folded hands, while a smile of
peace stole over the worn, troubled face, like one to whom
good news has been brought.</p>

<p>Suddenly Heidi paused. "Grandmother, are you feeling
quite well again already?"</p>

<p>"Yes, child, I have grown better while listening to you;
read it to the end."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></span></p>

<p>The child read on, and when she came to the last words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As the eyes grow dim, and darkness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Closes round, the soul grows clearer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sees the goal to which it travels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gladly feels its home is nearer."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the grandmother repeated them once or twice to herself, with
a look of happy expectation on her face. And Heidi took
equal pleasure in them, for the picture of the beautiful,
sunny day of her return home rose before her eyes, and she exclaimed
joyfully, "Grandmother, I know exactly what it is
like to go home."</p>

<p>A little later Heidi said, "It is growing dark and I must
go; I am so glad to think that you are quite well again."</p>

<p>She ran into the next room, and bid Peter come quickly,
for it had now grown quite dark. But when they got outside
they found the moon shining down on the white snow and
everything as clear as in the daylight. Peter got his sled, put
Heidi at the back, he himself sitting in front to guide, and
down the mountain they shot like two birds darting through
the air.</p>


<p>When Heidi was lying that night on her high bed of hay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span>
she thought of the grandmother on her low pillow, and of all
she had said about the light and comfort that awoke in her
when she heard the hymns, and she thought: if I could read to
her every day, then I should go on making her better. But she
knew that it would be a week, if not two, before she would be
able to go up the mountain again. This was a thought of great
trouble to Heidi, and she tried hard to think of some way
which would enable the grandmother to hear the words she
loved every day. Suddenly an idea struck her, and she was
so delighted with it that she could hardly bear to wait for
morning, so eager was she to begin carrying out her plan. All
at once she sat upright in her bed, for she had been so busy
with her thoughts that she had forgotten to say her prayers,
and she never now finished her day without saying them.</p>

<p>When she had prayed with all her heart for herself, her
grandfather and grandmother, she lay back again on the

<small>HEIDI TEACHES OBSTINATE PETER</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">P<span class="smcap">eter</span> arrived punctually at school the following day.
He had brought his dinner with him, for all the children
who lived at a distance regularly seated themselves at mid-day
on the tables, and resting their feet firmly on the benches,
spread out their meal on their knees and so ate their dinner,
while those living in Doerfli went home for theirs. Till one
o'clock they might all do as they liked, and then school began
again. As soon as Peter finished his lessons he went over to
Uncle's to see Heidi.</p>

<p>When he walked into the large room at Uncle's today,
Heidi immediately rushed forward and took hold of him and
said: "I've thought of something, Peter."</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You must learn to read," she informed him.</p>

<p>"I have learnt," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, but I mean so that you can really make use of
it," continued Heidi eagerly.</p>

<p>"I never shall," was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>"Nobody believes that you cannot learn, nor I either
now," said Heidi in a very decided tone of voice. "Grandmamma
in Frankfurt said long ago that it was not true, and
she told me not to believe you."</p>

<p>Peter looked rather taken aback at this piece of intelligence.</p>

<p>"I will soon teach you to read, for I know how," continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span>
Heidi. "You must learn at once, and then you can
read one or two hymns every day to grandmother."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't care about that," he grumbled in reply.</p>

<p>This hard-hearted way of refusing to agree to what was
right and kind, and to what Heidi had so much at heart,
aroused her anger. With flashing eyes she stood facing the
boy and said threateningly, "If you won't learn as I want you
to, I will tell you what will happen; you know your mother
has often spoken of sending you to Frankfurt, that you may
learn a lot of things, and I know where the boys there have to
go to school; Clara pointed out the great house to me when
we were driving together. And they don't only go when they
are boys, but have more lessons still when they are grown
men. I have seen them myself, and you mustn't think they
have only one kind teacher like we have. There are ever so
many of them, all in the school at the same time, and they are
all dressed in black, as if they were going to church, and have
black hats on their heads as high as that&mdash;" and Heidi held
out her hand to show their height from the floor.</p>

<p>Peter felt a cold shudder run down his back.</p>

<p>"And you will have to go in among all those gentlemen,"
continued Heidi with increasing animation, "and when it
comes to your turn you won't be able to read and will make
mistakes in your spelling. Then you'll see how they'll make
fun of you; even worse than Tinette, and you ought to have
seen what she was like when she was scornful."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll learn then," said Peter, half sorrowfully and
half angrily.</p>

<p>Heidi was instantly mollified. "That's right, then we'll
begin at once," she said cheerfully.</p>

<p>Among other presents Clara had sent Heidi a book which
the latter had decided would be just the thing for teaching
Peter, as it was an A B C book with rhyming lines. So the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span>
two sat together at the table with their heads bent over the
book, and began the lesson.</p>

<p>Peter was made to spell out the first sentence two or
three times over, for Heidi wished him to get it correct and
fluent. At last she said, "You don't seem able to get it right,
but I will read it aloud to you once; when you know what it
ought to be you will find it easier." And she read out:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A B C must be learnt today<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the judge will call you up to pay.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I shan't go," said Peter obstinately.</p>

<p>"Go where?" asked Heidi.</p>

<p>"Before the judge," he answered.</p>

<p>"Well then make haste and learn these three letters,
then you won't have to go."</p>

<p>Peter went at his task again and repeated the three letters
so many times and with such determination that she said
at last,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must know those three now."</p>

<p>Seeing what an effect the first two lines of verse had had
upon him, she thought she would prepare the ground a little
for the following lessons.</p>

<p>"Wait, and I will read you some of the next sentences,"
she continued, "then you will see what else there is to expect."</p>

<p>And she began in a clear slow voice:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">D E F G must run with ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or something will follow that does not please.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Should H I J K be now forgot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disgrace is yours upon the spot.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then L M must follow at once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or punished you'll be for a sorry dunce.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If you knew what next awaited you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'd haste to learn N O P Q.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now R S T be quick about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or worse will follow there's little doubt.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span></p>
<p>Heidi paused, for Peter was so quiet that she looked to
see what he was doing. These many secret threats and hints
of dreadful punishments had so affected him that he sat as if
petrified and stared at Heidi with horror-stricken eyes. Her
kind heart was moved at once, and she said, wishing to reassure
him, "You need not be afraid, Peter; come here to me
every evening, and if you learn as you have today you will at
least know all your letters, and the other things won't come.
But you must come regularly, not only now and then as you
do to school; even if it snows it won't hurt you."</p>

<p>He promised, and the lessons being finished for this day
he now went home.</p>

<p>Peter obeyed Heidi's instructions punctually, and every
evening went diligently to work to learn the letters, taking
the sentences thoroughly to heart. The grandfather was
frequently in the room smoking his pipe comfortably while
the lesson was going on, and his face twitched occasionally as
if he was overtaken with a sudden fit of merriment. Peter
was often invited to stay to supper after the great exertion
he had gone through, which richly compensated him for the
anguish of mind he had suffered with the sentence for the
day.</p>

<p>So the winter went by, and Peter really made progress
with his letters; but he went through a terrible fight each day
with the sentences.</p>

<p>He had got at last to U. Heidi read out:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And if you put the U for V,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'll go where you would not like to be.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Peter growled, "Yes, but I shan't go!" But he was very
diligent that day, as if under the impression that some one
would seize him suddenly by the collar and drag him where
he would rather not go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span></p>

<p>The next evening Heidi read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If you falter at W, worst of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look at the stick against the wall.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Peter looked at the wall and said scornfully, "There
isn't one."</p>

<p>"Yes, but do you know what grandfather has in his
box?" asked Heidi. "A stick as thick almost as your arm,
and if he took that out, you might well say, look at the stick
on the wall."</p>

<p>Peter knew that thick hazel stick, and immediately bent
his head over the W and struggled to master it.</p>

<p>Another day the lines ran:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then comes the X for you to say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or be sure you'll get no food today.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Peter looked towards the cupboard where the bread and
cheese were kept, and said crossly, "I never said that I
should forget the X."</p>

<p>"That's all right; if you don't forget it we can go on to
learn the next, and then you will only have one more," replied
Heidi, anxious to encourage him.</p>

<p>Peter did not quite understand, but when Heidi went on
and read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And should you make a stop at Y<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They'll point at you and cry, Fie, fie.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All the gentlemen in Frankfurt with tall black hats on their
heads, and scorn and mockery in their faces rose up before
his mind's eye, and he threw himself with energy on the Y,
not letting it go till at last he knew it so thoroughly that he
could see what it was like even when he shut his eyes.</p>

<p>He arrived on the following day in a somewhat lofty
frame of mind, for there was now only one letter to struggle
over, and when Heidi began the lesson with reading aloud:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Make haste with Z, if you're too slow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Off to the Hottentots you'll go.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span></p>
<p>Peter remarked scornfully, "I dare say, when no one knows
even where such people live."</p>

<p>"I assure you, Peter," replied Heidi, "grandfather
knows all about them. Wait a second and I will run and ask
him, for he is only over the way with the pastor." And she
rose and ran to the door to put her words into action, but
Peter cried out in a voice of agony,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stop!" for he already saw himself being carried off by
Alm-Uncle and the pastor and sent straight away to the Hottentots,
since as yet he did not know his last letter. His cry
of fear brought Heidi back.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she asked in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Nothing! come back! I am going to learn my letter,"
he said, stammering with fear. Heidi, however, herself
wished to know where the Hottentots lived and persisted that
she should ask her grandfather, but she gave in at last to
Peter's despairing entreaties. She insisted on his doing
something in return, and so not only had he to repeat his Z
until it was so fixed in his memory that he could never forget
it again, but she began teaching him to spell, and Peter really
made a good start that evening. So it went on from day to
day.</p>

<p>The frost had gone and the snow was soft again, and
moreover fresh snow continually fell, so that it was quite
three weeks before Heidi could go to the grandmother again.
So much the more eagerly did she pursue her teaching so that
Peter might compensate for her absence by reading hymns
to the old woman. One evening he walked in home after
leaving Heidi, and as he entered he said, "I can do it now."</p>

<p>"Do what, Peter?" asked his mother.</p>

<p>"Read," he answered.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean it? Did you hear that, Grandmother?"
she called out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span></p>

<p>The grandmother had heard, and was already wondering
how such a thing could have come to pass.</p>

<p>"I must read one of the hymns now; Heidi told me to,"
he went on to inform them. His mother hastily brought the
book, and the grandmother lay in joyful expectation, for it
was so long since she had heard the good words. Peter sat
down to the table and began to read. His mother sat beside
him listening with surprise and exclaiming at the close of
each verse, "Who would have thought it possible!"</p>

<p>The grandmother did not speak though she followed the
words he read with strained attention.</p>

<p>It happened on the day following this that there was a
reading lesson in Peter's class. When it came to his turn, the
teacher said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We must pass over Peter as usual, or will you try again
once more&mdash;I will not say to read, but to stammer through a
sentence."</p>

<p>Peter took the book and read off three lines without the
slightest hesitation.</p>

<p>The teacher put down his book and stared at Peter as at
some out-of-the-way and marvelous thing unseen before. At
last he spoke,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Peter, some miracle has been performed upon you!
Here have I been striving with unheard-of patience to teach
you and you have not hitherto been able to say your letters
even. And now, just as I had made up my mind not to waste
any more trouble upon you, you suddenly are able to read a
whole sentence properly and distinctly. How has such a
miracle come to pass in our days?"</p>

<p>"It was Heidi," answered Peter.</p>

<p>The teacher looked in astonishment towards Heidi, who
was sitting innocently on her bench with no appearance of
anything supernatural about her. He continued, "I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span>
noticed a change in you altogether, Peter. Whereas formerly
you often missed coming to school for a week, or even weeks
at a time, you have lately not stayed away a single day. Who
has wrought this change for good in you?"</p>


<p>"It was Uncle," answered Peter.</p>

<p>With increasing surprise the teacher looked from Peter
to Heidi and back again at Peter.</p>

<p>"We will try once more," he said cautiously, and Peter
had again to show off his accomplishment by reading another
three lines. There was no mistake about it&mdash;Peter could
read.</p>

<p>As soon as school was over the teacher went over to the
pastor to tell him this piece of news, and to inform him of the
happy result of Heidi's and the grandfather's combined efforts.</p>

<p>Every evening Peter read one hymn aloud; so far he
obeyed Heidi. Nothing would induce him to read a second,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span>
and indeed the grandmother never asked for it. His mother
Brigitta could not get over her surprise at her son's attainment,
and when the reader was in bed would often express
her pleasure at it. "Now he has learnt to read there is no
knowing what may be made of him yet."</p>

<p>On one of these occasions the grandmother answered,
"Yes, it is good for him to have learnt something, but I shall
indeed be thankful when spring is here again and Heidi can
come; they are not like the same hymns when Peter reads
them. So many words seem missing, and I try to think what
they ought to be and then I lose the sense, and so the hymns
do not come home to my heart as when Heidi reads them."</p>

<p>The truth was that Peter arranged to make his reading
as little troublesome for himself as possible. When he came
upon a word that he thought was too long or difficult in any
other way, he left it out, for he decided that a word or two less
in a verse, where there were so many of them, could make no
difference to his grandmother. And so it came about that
most of the principal words were missing in the hymns that
Peter read aloud.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="ChXX." id="ChXX."></a>CHAPTER XX<br />
<small>A STRANGE LOOKING PROCESSION</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span> was the month of May. The clear, warm sunshine lay
upon the mountain, which had turned green again. The
last snows had disappeared and the sun had already coaxed
many of the flowers to show their bright heads above the
grass. Heidi was at home again on the mountain, running
backwards and forwards in her accustomed way, not knowing
which spot was most delightful.</p>

<p>From the shed at the back came the sound of sawing and
chopping, and Heidi listened to it with pleasure, for it was
the old familiar sound she had known from the beginning of
her life up here. Suddenly she jumped up and ran round, for
she must know what her grandfather was doing. In front of
the shed door already stood a finished new chair, and a second
was in course of construction under the grandfather's skilful
hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know what these are for," exclaimed Heidi in
great glee. "We shall want them when they all come from
Frankfurt. This one is for grandmamma, and the one you
are now making is for Clara, and then&mdash;then there will, I
suppose, have to be another," continued Heidi with more
hesitation in her voice, "or do you think, Grandfather, that
perhaps Miss Rottermeyer will not come with them?"</p>

<p>"Well, I cannot say just yet," replied her grandfather,
"but it will be safer to make one so that we can offer her a
seat if she does."</p>

<p>While talking with the grandfather there was heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></span>
from above a whistling and calling which Heidi immediately
recognized. She ran out and found herself surrounded by
her four-footed friends. They were apparently as pleased as
she was to be among the heights again, for they leaped about
and bleated for joy. When Peter at last got up to her he
handed her a letter.</p>

<p>"There!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Did some one give you this while you were out with the
goats," she asked, in her surprise.</p>

<p>"No," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Where did you get it from then?"</p>

<p>"I found it in the dinner bag."</p>

<p>Which was true to a certain extent. The letter to Heidi
had been given him the evening before by the postman at
Doerfli, and Peter had put it into his empty bag. That morning
he had stuffed his bread and cheese on the top of it, and
had forgotten it when he called for Alm-Uncle's two goats;
only when he had finished his bread and cheese at mid-day
and was searching in the bag for any last crumbs did he remember
the letter which lay at the bottom.</p>

<p>Heidi read the address carefully; then she ran back to
the shed holding out her letter to her grandfather in high glee.
"From Frankfurt! from Clara! Would you like to hear it?"</p>

<p>The grandfather was ready and pleased to do so, as was
Peter, who had followed Heidi into the shed.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dearest Heidi</span>,&mdash;Everything is packed and we shall start
now in two or three days, as soon as papa himself is ready
to leave; he is not coming with us as he has first to go to
Paris. The doctor comes every day, and as soon as he is
inside the door, he cries, 'Off now as quickly as you can, off
to the mountain.' He is most impatient about our going. You
cannot think how much he enjoyed himself when he was with
you! He has called nearly every day this winter, and each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span>
time he describes over again all he did with you and the
grandfather, and talks of the mountains and the flowers and
of the great silence up there far above all towns and villages,
and of the fresh, delicious air, and often adds, 'No one can
help getting well up there.' He himself is quite a different
man since his visit, and looks happy again. Oh, how I am
looking forward to seeing everything and to being with you
on the mountain, and to making the acquaintance of Peter
and the goats.</p>


<p>"I shall have first to go through a six weeks' cure at
Ragatz; this the doctor has ordered, and then we shall move
up to Doerfli, and every fine day I shall be carried up the
mountain in my chair and spend the day with you. Grandmamma
is traveling with me and will remain with me; she
also is delighted at the thought of paying you a visit. But
just imagine, Miss Rottermeyer refuses to come with us. Almost
every day grandmamma says to her, 'Well, how about
this Swiss journey, my worthy Rottermeyer? Pray say if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></span>
you really would like to come with us.' But she always
thanks grandmamma very politely and says she has quite
made up her mind. I think I know what has done it: Sebastian
gave such a frightful description of the mountain, of
how the rocks were so overhanging and dangerous that at any
minute you might fall into a crevasse, and how it was such
steep climbing that you feared at every step to go slipping to
the bottom, and that goats alone could make their way up
without fear of being killed. She shuddered when she heard
him tell of all this, and since then she has not been so enthusiastic
about Switzerland as she was before. Fear has also
taken possession of Tinette, and she also refuses to come. So
grandmamma and I will be alone; Sebastian will go with us
as far as Ragatz and then return here.</p>

<p>"I can hardly bear waiting till I see you again. Good-bye,
dearest Heidi; grandmamma sends you her best love and
all good wishes.&mdash;Your affectionate friend, <span class="smcap">Clara</span>."</p>

<p>As soon as the letter had been read, Peter rushed out,
twirling his stick in the air in such a reckless fashion that the
frightened goats fled down the mountain before him with
higher and wider leaps than usual. He followed at full speed,
his stick still raised in air in a menacing manner as if he was
longing to vent his fury on some invisible foe. This foe was
indeed the prospect of the arrival of the Frankfurt visitors,
the thought of whom filled him with exasperation.</p>

<p>Heidi was so full of joyful anticipation that she determined
to seize the first possible moment next day to go down
and tell grandmother who was coming, and also particularly
who was not coming. The old lady was no longer confined to
her bed. She was back in her corner at her spinning-wheel,
but there was an expression on her face of mournful anxiety.
Peter had come in the evening before, brimful of anger and
had told about the large party who were coming up from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></span>
Frankfurt, and he did not know what other things might
happen after that; and the old woman had not slept all night,
pursued by the old thought of Heidi being taken from her.</p>

<p>Heidi ran in, and taking her little stool immediately sat
down by grandmother and began eagerly pouring out all her
news, growing more excited with her pleasure as she went on.
But all of a sudden she stopped short and said anxiously,
"What is the matter, Grandmother, aren't you a bit pleased
with what I am telling you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, of course, child, since it gives you so much
pleasure," she answered, trying to look more cheerful.</p>

<p>"But I can see all the same that something troubles you.
Is it because you think after all that Miss Rottermeyer may
come?" asked Heidi, beginning to feel anxious herself.</p>

<p>"No, no! it is nothing, child," said the grandmother,
wishing to reassure her. "Just give me your hand that I
may feel sure you are there. No doubt it would be the best
thing for you, although I feel I could scarcely survive it."</p>

<p>"I do not want anything of the best if you could scarcely
survive it," said Heidi, in such a determined tone of voice
that the grandmother's fears increased as she felt sure the
people from Frankfurt were coming to take Heidi back with
them, since now she was well again they naturally wished to
have her with them once more. But she was anxious to hide
her trouble from Heidi if possible, as the latter was so sympathetic
that she might refuse perhaps to go away, and that
would not be right.</p>

<p>"Heidi," she said, "there is something that would comfort
me and calm my thoughts; read me the hymn beginning:
'All things will work for good.'"</p>

<p>Heidi found the place at once and read out in her clear,
young voice:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All things will work for good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those who trust in Me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I come with healing on my wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save and set thee free.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Yes, yes, that is just what I wanted to hear," said the
grandmother, and the deep expression of trouble passed from
her face. Heidi looked at her thoughtfully for a minute or
two and then said, "healing means that which cures everything
and makes everybody well, doesn't it, Grandmother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is it," replied the old woman with a nod of
assent, "and we may be sure everything will come to pass according
to God's good purpose."</p>

<p>When the evening came, Heidi returned home up the
mountain. The stars came out overhead one by one, so bright
and sparkling that each seemed to send a fresh ray of joy into
her heart.</p>

<p>Not only were the nights of this month of May so clear
and bright, but the days as well; the sun rose every morning
into the cloudless sky, as undimmed in its splendor as when it
sank the evening before, and the grandfather would look out
early and exclaim with astonishment, "This is indeed a
wonderful year of sun; it will make all the shrubs and plants
grow apace; you will have to see, General, that your army
does not get out of hand from overfeeding." And Peter would
swing his stick with an air of assurance and an expression on
his face as much as to say, "I'll see to that."</p>

<p>So May passed, everything growing greener and greener,
and then came the month of June, with a hotter sun and long,
light days, that brought the flowers out all over the mountain,
so that every spot was bright with them and the air full of
their sweet scents. This month too was drawing to its close
when one day Heidi, having finished her household duties,
ran out with the intention of paying first a visit to the fir
trees, and then going up higher to see if the bush of rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></span>
roses was yet in bloom, for its flowers were so lovely when
standing open in the sun. But just as she was turning the
corner of the hut, she gave such a loud cry that her grandfather
came running out of the shed to see what had happened.</p>

<p>"Grandfather, Grandfather!" she cried, beside herself
with excitement. "Come here! look! look!"</p>

<p>The old man was by her side by this time and looked in
the direction of her outstretched hand.</p>

<p>A strange-looking procession was making its way up the
mountain; in front were two men carrying a sedan chair, in
which sat a girl well wrapped up in shawls; then followed a
horse, mounted by a stately-looking lady who was looking
about her with great interest and talking to the guide who
walked beside her; then a reclining chair, which was being
pushed up by another man, it having evidently been thought
safer to send the invalid to whom it belonged up the steep path
in a sedan chair. The procession wound up with a porter,
with such a bundle of cloaks, shawls, and furs on his back that
it rose well above his head.</p>

<p>"Here they come! here they come!" shouted Heidi,
jumping with joy. And sure enough it was the party from
Frankfurt; the figures came nearer and nearer, and at last
they had actually arrived. The men in front put down their
burden, Heidi rushed forward and the two children embraced
each other with mutual delight. Grandmamma having also
reached the top, dismounted, and gave Heidi an affectionate
greeting, before turning to the grandfather, who had meanwhile
come up to welcome his guests. There was no constraint
about the meeting, for they both knew each other
perfectly well from hearsay and felt like old acquaintances.</p>

<p>After the first words of greeting had been exchanged
grandmamma broke out into lively expressions of admiration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></span>
"What a magnificent residence you have, Uncle! I could
hardly have believed it was so beautiful! A king might well
envy you! And how well my little Heidi looks&mdash;like a wild
rose!" she continued, drawing the child towards her and
stroking her fresh pink cheeks. "I don't know which way to
look first, it is all so lovely! What do you say to it, Clara,
what do you say?"</p>

<p>Clara was gazing round entranced; she had never imagined,
much less seen, anything so beautiful. She gave vent to
her delight in cries of joy. "O Grandmamma," she said, "I
should like to remain here for ever."</p>

<p>The grandfather had meanwhile drawn up the invalid
chair and spread some of the wraps over it; he now went up
to Clara.</p>

<p>"Supposing we carry the little daughter now to her accustomed
chair; I think she will be more comfortable, the
travelling sedan is rather hard," he said, and without waiting
for any one to help him he lifted the child in his strong arms
and laid her gently down on her own couch. He then covered
her over carefully and arranged her feet on the soft cushion,
as if he had never done anything all his life but wait on
cripples. The grandmamma looked on with surprise.</p>

<p>"My dear Uncle," she exclaimed, "if I knew where you
had learned to nurse I would at once send all the nurses I
know to the same place that they might handle their patients
in like manner. How do you come to know so much?"</p>

<p>Uncle smiled. "I know more from experience than training,"
he answered, but as he spoke the smile died away and
a look of sadness passed over his face. The vision rose before
him of a face of suffering that he had known long years
before, the face of a man lying crippled on his couch of pain,
and unable to move a limb. The man had been his captain
during the fierce fighting in Sicily; he had found him lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span>
wounded and had carried him away, and after that the captain
would suffer no one else near him, and Uncle had stayed and
nursed him till his sufferings ended in death. It all came
back to Uncle now, and it seemed natural to him to attend the
sick Clara and to show her all those kindly attentions with
which he had once been so familiar.</p>

<p>"O Heidi, if only I could walk about with you," said
Clara longingly, "if I could but go and look at the fir trees and
at everything I know so well from your description, although
I have never been here before."</p>

<p>Heidi in response put out all her strength, and after a
slight effort, managed to wheel Clara's chair quite easily
round the hut to the fir trees. There they paused. Clara had
never seen such trees before, with their tall, straight stems,
and long, thick branches growing thicker and thicker till they
touched the ground. Even the grandmamma, who had followed
the children, was astonished at the sight of them.</p>

<p>Heidi had now wheeled Clara toward the goat shed, and
had flung open the door, so that Clara might have a full view
of the inside. Clara lamented to her grandmother that they
would have to leave early before the goats came home. "I
should so like to have seen Peter and his whole flock."</p>

<p>"Oh, the flowers!" exclaimed Clara. "Look at the
bushes of red flowers, and all the nodding blue bells! Oh, if I
could but get out and pick some!"</p>

<p>Heidi ran off at once and picked her a large nosegay of
them.</p>

<p>"But these are nothing, Clara," she said, laying the
flowers on her lap. "If you could come up higher to where
the goats are feeding, then you would indeed see something!
Bushes on bushes of the red centaury, and ever so many more
of the blue-bell flowers; and then the bright yellow rock roses,
that gleam like pure gold, and all crowding together in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span>
one spot. And then there are others with the large leaves
that grandfather calls Bright Eyes, and the brown ones with
little round heads that smell so delicious. Oh, it is beautiful
up there, and if you sit down among them you never want to
get up again, everything looks and smells so lovely!"</p>

<p>Heidi's eyes sparkled with the remembrance of what she
was describing; she was longing herself to see it all again, and
Clara caught her enthusiasm and looked back at her with
equal longing in her soft blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Grandmamma, do you think I could get up there? Is
it possible for me to go?" she asked eagerly. "If only I
could walk, climb about everywhere with you, Heidi!"</p>

<p>"I am sure I could push you up, the chair goes so easily,"
said Heidi, and in proof of her words, she sent the chair at
such a pace round the corner that it nearly went flying down
the mountain-side. Grandmamma being at hand, however,
stopped it in time.</p>

<p>The grandfather, meantime, had not been idle. He had
by this time put the table and extra chairs in front of the seat,
so that they might all sit out here and eat the dinner that was
preparing inside. The milk and the cheese were soon ready,
and then the company sat down in high spirits to their mid-day
meal.</p>

<p>Grandmamma was enchanted, as the doctor had been,
with their dining-room, whence one could see far along the
valley, and far over the mountains to the farthest stretch of
blue sky. A light wind blew refreshingly over them as they
sat at table, and the rustling of the fir trees made a festive accompaniment
to the repast.</p>

<p>"I never enjoyed anything as much as this. It is really
superb!" cried grandmamma two or three times over; and
then suddenly in a tone of surprise, "Do I really see you
taking a second piece of toasted cheese, Clara!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></span></p>

<p>There, sure enough, was a second golden-colored slice of
cheese on Clara's plate.</p>

<p>"Oh, it does taste so nice, Grandmamma&mdash;better than
all the dishes we have at Ragatz," replied Clara, as she continued
eating with appetite.</p>

<p>"That's right, eat what you can!" exclaimed Uncle. "It's
the mountain air, which makes up for the deficiencies of the
kitchen."</p>

<p>And so the meal went on. Grandmamma and Alm-Uncle
got on very well together, and their conversation became more
and more lively. They were so thoroughly agreed in their
opinions of men and things and the world in general that
they might have been taken for old cronies. The time passed
merrily, and then grandmamma looked towards the west and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We must soon get ready to go, Clara, the sun is a good
way down; the men will be here directly with the horse and
sedan."</p>

<p>Clara's face fell, and she said beseechingly, "Oh, just
another hour, Grandmamma, or two hours. We haven't seen
inside the hut yet, or Heidi's bed, or any of the other things.
If only the day was ten hours long!"</p>

<p>"Well, that is not possible," said grandmamma, but she
herself was anxious to see inside the hut, so they all rose from
the table and Uncle wheeled Clara's chair to the door. But
there they came to a standstill, for the chair was much too
broad to pass through the door. Uncle, however, soon settled
the difficulty by lifting Clara in his strong arms and carrying
her inside.</p>

<p>Grandmamma went all round and examined the household
arrangements, and was very much amused and pleased
at their orderliness and the cozy appearance of everything.
"And this is your bedroom up here, Heidi, is it not?" she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a></span>
asked, as without fear she mounted the ladder to the hay loft.
"Oh, it does smell sweet, what a healthy place to sleep in."
She went up to the round window and looked out, and grandfather
followed up with Clara in his arms, Heidi springing
up after them. Then they all stood and examined Heidi's
wonderful hay-bed, and grandmamma looked thoughtfully at
it and drew in from time to time fragrant draughts of the
hay-perfumed air, while Clara was charmed beyond words
with the sleeping apartment.</p>

<p>"It is delightful for you up here, Heidi! You can look
from your bed straight into the sky, and then such a delicious
smell all round you! and outside the fir trees waving and
rustling! I have never seen such a pleasant, cheerful bedroom
before."</p>

<p>Uncle looked across at the grandmamma. "I have been
thinking," he said to her, "that if you were willing to agree
to it, your little granddaughter might remain up here, and I
am sure she would grow stronger. You have brought
up all kinds of shawls and covers with you, and we could
make up a soft bed out of them, and as to looking after the
child, you need have no fear, for I will see to that."</p>

<p>Clara and Heidi were as overjoyed at these words as if
they were two birds let out of their cages, and grandmamma's
face beamed with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You are indeed kind, my dear Uncle," she exclaimed.
"I was just thinking myself that a stay up here might be the
very thing she wanted. But then the trouble, the inconvenience
to yourself! And you speak of nursing and looking
after her as if it were a mere nothing! I thank you sincerely, I
thank you from my whole heart, Uncle." And she took his
hand and gave it a long and grateful shake, which he returned
with a pleased expression of countenance.</p>

<p>Uncle immediately set to work to get things ready. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></span>
carried Clara back to her chair outside, Heidi following, not
knowing how to jump high enough into the air to express her
contentment. Then he gathered up a whole pile of shawls
and furs and said, smiling, "It is a good thing that grandmamma
came up well provided for a winter's campaign; we
shall be able to make good use of these."</p>

<p>The two had meanwhile ascended to the hay-loft and
begun to prepare a bed; there were so many articles piled one
over the other that when finished it looked like a regular little
fortress. Grandmamma passed her hand carefully over it to
make sure that there were no bits of hay sticking out. "If
there's a bit that can come through it will," she said. The
soft mattress, however, was so smooth and thick that nothing
could penetrate it. Then they went down again well satisfied,
and found the children laughing and talking together and arranging
all they were going to do from morning till evening
as long as Clara stayed. The next question was how long
she was to remain, and first grandmamma was asked, but she
referred them to the grandfather, who gave it as his opinion
that she ought to make trial of the mountain air for at least a
month. The children clapped their hands for joy, for they
had not expected to be together for so long a time.</p>

<p>The bearers and the horse and guide were now seen approaching;
the former were sent back at once, and grandmamma
prepared to mount for her return journey.</p>

<p>"It's not saying good-bye, Grandmamma," Clara called
out, "for you will come up now and then and see how we are
getting on, and we shall so look forward to your visits."</p>

<p>Grandmamma mounted her sturdy animal, and Uncle
took the bridle to lead her down the steep mountain path; she
begged him not to come far with her, but he insisted on seeing
her safely as far as Doerfli, for the way was precipitous
and not without danger for the rider, he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span></p>

<p>Grandmamma did not care to stay alone in Doerfli, and
therefore decided to return to Ragatz, and thence to make
excursions up the mountain from time to time.</p>


<p>Peter came down with his goats before Uncle had returned.
As soon as the animals caught sight of Heidi they
all came flocking towards her, and she, as well as Clara on
her couch, were soon surrounded by the goats, pushing and
poking their heads one over the other, while Heidi introduced
each in turn by its name to her friend Clara.</p>

<p>It was not long before the latter had made the long-wished-for
acquaintance of little Snowflake, the lively Greenfinch,
and the well-behaved goats belonging to grandfather,
as well as of the many others, including the Grand Turk.
Peter meanwhile stood apart looking on, and casting somewhat
unfriendly glances towards Clara.</p>

<p>When the two children called out, "Good-evening,
Peter," he made no answer, but swung his stick angrily, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span>
wanting to cut the air in two, and then ran off with his goats
after him.</p>

<p>The climax to all the beautiful things that Clara had already
seen upon the mountain came at the close of the day.</p>

<p>As she lay on the large, soft bed in the hay loft, with
Heidi near her, she looked out through the round, open window
right into the middle of the shining clusters of stars, and
she exclaimed in delight,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Heidi, it's just as if we were in a high carriage and were
going to drive straight into heaven."</p>

<p>"Yes, and do you know why the stars are so happy and
look down and nod to us like that?" asked Heidi.</p>

<p>"No, why is it?" Clara asked in return.</p>

<p>"Because they live up in heaven, and know how well God
arranges everything for us, so that we need have no more fear
or trouble and may be quite sure that all things will come
right in the end. But then we must never forget to pray, and
to ask God to remember us when He is arranging things, so
that we too may feel safe and have no anxiety about what is
going to happen."</p>

<p>The two children now sat up and said their prayers, and
then Heidi put her head down on her little round arm and fell
off to sleep at once, but Clara lay awake some time, for she
could not get over the wonder of this new experience of being
in bed up here among the stars. She had indeed seldom seen
a star, for she never went outside the house at night, and the
curtains at home were always drawn before the stars came
out. Each time she closed her eyes she felt she must open
them again to see if the two very large stars were still looking
in, and nodding to her as Heidi said they did. There they
were, always in the same place. At last her eyes closed of
their own accord, and it was only in her dreams that she still
saw the two large, friendly stars shining down upon her.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="ChXXI." id="ChXXI."></a>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<small>HAPPY DAYS FOR THE LITTLE VISITOR</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">N<span class="smcap">ext</span> morning at sunrise Alm-Uncle went softly up the
ladder to see if the children were awake yet. Clara had
just opened her eyes and was looking with wonder at the
bright sunlight that shone through the round window and
danced and sparkled about her bed. She could not at first
think where she was, until she caught sight of Heidi sleeping
beside her, and heard the grandfather's cheery voice asking
her if she had slept well. She assured him that when she had
once fallen asleep she had not opened her eyes again all night.
The grandfather was satisfied at this and immediately began
to help her dress with so much gentleness and understanding
that it seemed as if his chief calling had been to look after sick
children.</p>

<p>When Heidi awoke she was surprised to see Clara
dressed, and already in the grandfather's arms ready to be
carried down. She hurried up too and soon ran down the ladder
and out of the hut, and there further astonishment
awaited her, for grandfather had been busy the night before
after they were in bed. Seeing that it was impossible to get
Clara's chair through the hut-door, he had taken down two of
the boards at the side of the shed and made an opening large
enough to admit the chair; these he left loose so that they
could be taken away and put up at pleasure. He was at this
moment wheeling Clara out into the sun; he left her in front
of the hut while he went to look after the goats and Heidi ran
up to her friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span></p>

<p>"O Heidi, if only I could stay up here for ever with you,"
exclaimed Clara happily, turning in her chair from side to
side that she might drink in the air and sun from all quarters.</p>

<p>"Now you see that it is just what I told you," replied
Heidi delighted; "that it is the most beautiful thing in the
world to be up here with grandfather."</p>

<p>The latter at that moment appeared coming from the goat
shed and bringing two small foaming bowls of snow-white
milk&mdash;one for Clara and one for Heidi.</p>

<p>"That will do the little daughter good," he said, nodding
to Clara; "it is from Little Swan and will make her strong.
To your health, child! drink it up."</p>

<p>Clara had never tasted goat's milk before; she hesitated
and smelt it before putting it to her lips, but seeing how Heidi
drank hers up without hesitating, and how much she seemed
to like it, Clara did the same, and drank till there was not a
drop left, for she too found it delicious, tasting just as if sugar
and cinnamon had been mixed with it.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow we will drink two," said the grandfather,
who had looked on with satisfaction at seeing her follow
Heidi's example.</p>

<p>When Peter arrived with the goats, Uncle drew him aside
and said, "From today be sure you let Little Swan go where
she likes. She knows where to find the best food for herself,
and so if she wants to climb higher, you follow her, and it will
do the others no harm if they go too. A little more climbing
won't hurt you, and in this matter she probably knows better
than you what is good for her; I want her to give as fine milk
as possible. So now be off and remember what I say, and
don't look so cross about it."</p>


<p>Peter was accustomed to give immediate obedience to
Uncle, and he marched off with his goats, but with a turn of
the head and roll of the eye that showed he had some thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span>
in reserve. The goats carried Heidi along with them a little
way, which was what Peter wanted. "You will have to come
with them," he called to her, "for I shall be obliged to follow
Little Swan."</p>

<p>"I cannot," Heidi called back from the midst of her
friends, "and I shall not be able to come for a long, long time&mdash;not
as long as Clara is with me. Grandfather, however,
has promised to go up the mountain with both of us some
day."</p>

<p>As Heidi ran back to Clara, Peter doubled his fists and
made threatening gestures towards the invalid on her couch,
and then climbed up some distance without pause until he was
out of sight, for he was afraid Uncle might have seen him.</p>

<p>Clara and Heidi had made so many plans for themselves
that they hardly knew where to begin. Heidi suggested that
they should first write to grandmamma, to whom they had
promised to send word every day, for grandmamma had not
felt sure whether it would in the long run suit Clara's health
to remain up the mountain. With daily news of her granddaughter
she could stay on without anxiety at Ragatz, and
yet be ready to go to Clara at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>"Must we go indoors to write?" asked Clara. It is so
much nicer out here. So Heidi ran in and brought out her
school-book and writing things and her own little stool. She
put her reading book and copy book on Clara's knees, to make
a desk for her to write upon, and she herself took her seat on
the stool by the bench, and then they both began writing to
grandmamma. But Clara paused after every sentence to
look about her; it was too beautiful for much letter writing.
The breeze had sunk a little, and now only gently fanned her
face and whispered lightly through the fir trees. Now and
again the call of some shepherd-boy rang out through the air,
and the echo answered softly from the rocks. Thus the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span>
passed, the children hardly knew how, and soon grandfather
came with the mid-day bowls of steaming milk. Then
Heidi pushed Clara's chair under the fir trees, where they
spent the afternoon in the shade, telling each other all that
had happened since last they met. So the hours flew by and
all at once, as it seemed, the evening had come with the returning
Peter, who still scowled and looked angry.</p>


<p>"Good-night, Peter," called out Heidi, as she saw he had
no intention of stopping to speak.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Peter," called out Clara in a friendly voice.
Peter took no notice and went surlily on with his goats.</p>

<p>As Clara saw the grandfather leading away Little Swan
to milk her, she was suddenly taken with a longing for another
bowlful of the fragrant milk, and waited impatiently
for it.</p>

<p>"Isn't it curious, Heidi," she said, astonished at herself,
"as long as I can remember I have only eaten because I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></span>
was obliged to, and everything used to seem to taste of cod
liver oil, and I was always wishing there was no need to eat or
drink; and now I am longing for grandfather to bring me the
milk."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know what it feels like," replied Heidi, who remembered
the many days in Frankfurt when all her food used
to seem to stick in her throat. When grandfather at last
brought the evening milk, Clara drank it up so quickly that
she had emptied her bowl before Heidi, and then she asked for
a little more. The grandfather went inside with both the
children's bowls, and when he brought them out again full he
had something else to add to their supper. He had walked
over that afternoon to a herdsman's house where the sweetly-tasting
butter was made, and had brought home a large pat,
some of which he had now spread thickly on two good slices
of bread.</p>

<p>That night, when Clara lay down in her bed and prepared
to watch the stars, her eyes would not keep open, and she fell
asleep as soon as Heidi and slept soundly all night&mdash;a thing
she never remembered having done before. The following
day and the day after passed in the same pleasant fashion,
and the third day there came a surprise for the children. Two
stout porters came up the mountain, each carrying a bed on
his shoulders with bedding of all kinds and two beautiful new
white coverlids. The men also had a letter with them from
grandmamma, in which she said that these were for Clara and
Heidi, and that Heidi in future was always to sleep in a
proper bed, and when she went down to Doerfli in the winter
she was to take one with her and leave the other at the hut,
so that Clara might always know there was a bed ready for
her when she paid a visit to the mountain. She went on to
thank the children for their long letters and encouraged them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span>
to continue writing daily, so that she might be able to picture
all they were doing.</p>

<p>Grandfather went up the ladder and threw back the hay
from Heidi's bed on to the great heap, and soon the beds were
put up close to one another so that the children might still be
able to see out of the window, for he knew what pleasure they
had in the light from the sun and stars.</p>

<p>Meanwhile grandmamma down at Ragatz was rejoicing
at the excellent news of the invalid which reached her daily
from the mountain. Clara found the life more charming each
day and could not say enough of the kindness and care which
the grandfather lavished upon her, nor of Heidi's lively and
amusing companionship.</p>

<p>Having such fresh assurances each day that all was going
well with Clara, grandmamma thought she might put off her
visit to the children a little longer, for the steep ride up and
down was somewhat of a fatigue to her.</p>

<p>The grandfather seemed to feel an especial sympathy
for his little invalid charge, for he tried to think of something
fresh every day to help forward her recovery. He climbed up
the mountain every afternoon, higher and higher each day,
and came home in the evening with large bunches of leaves
which scented the air with a mingled fragrance as of carnations
and thyme. He hung them up in the goat shed for Little
Swan to eat so that she might give extra fine milk.</p>

<p>Clara had now been on the mountain for three weeks.
For some days past the grandfather, each morning after carrying
her down, had said, "Won't the little daughter try if
she can stand for a minute or two?" And Clara had made
the effort in order to please him, but had clung to him as soon
as her feet touched the ground, exclaiming that it hurt her so.
He let her try a little longer, however, each day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span></p>

<p>It was many years since they had had such a splendid
summer among the mountains. Day after day there were the
same cloudless sky and brilliant sun; the flowers opened wide
their fragrant blossoms, and everywhere the eye was greeted
with a glow of color; and when the evening came the crimson
light fell on mountain peaks and on the great snow-field, till
at last the sun sank in a sea of golden flame.</p>

<p>Heidi never tired of telling Clara of the beauty of the
spot on the higher slope of the mountain, where the bright
golden rock-roses grew in masses, and the blue flowers were
in such numbers that the very grass seemed to have turned
blue. An irrepressible longing came over her to see it all
once more. She ran to her grandfather, who was in the shed,
calling out almost before she was inside,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Grandfather, will you take us out with the goats tomorrow?
Oh, it is so lovely up there now!"</p>

<p>"Very well," he answered, "but if I do, little Clara must
do something to please me: she must try her best again this
evening to stand on her feet."</p>

<p>Heidi ran back with the good news to Clara, and the
latter promised to try her very best as the grandfather
wished, for she looked forward immensely to the next day's
excursion. Heidi was so pleased and excited that she called
out to Peter as soon as she caught sight of him that evening,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Peter, Peter, we are all coming out with you tomorrow
and are going to stay up there the whole day."</p>

<p>Peter, cross as a bear, grumbled some reply, and lifted
his stick to give Greenfinch a blow for no reason in particular,
but Greenfinch saw the movement, and with a leap over
Snowflake's back she got out of the way, and the stick only
hit the air.</p>

<p>Clara and Heidi got into their two fine beds that night
full of delightful anticipation of the morrow; they were so
full of their plans that they agreed to keep awake all night and
talk over them. But their heads had no sooner touched their
soft pillows than the conversation suddenly ceased, and Clara
fell into a dream of an immense field, which looked the color
of the sky, so thickly inlaid was it with blue, bell-shaped flowers;
and Heidi heard the great bird of prey calling to her
from the heights above, "Come! come! come!"</p>

<small>WICKED PETER AND THE UNLUCKY CHAIR</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">U<span class="smcap">ncle</span> went out early the next morning to see what kind
of a day it was going to be. There was a reddish gold
light over the higher peaks; a light breeze was springing up
and the branches of the fir trees moved gently to and fro&mdash;the
sun was on its way.</p>

<p>He wheeled the chair out of the shed ready for the coming
journey, and then went in to call the children and tell
them what a lovely sunrise it was.</p>

<p>Peter came up the mountain at this moment. The goats
did not gather round him so trustfully as usual, but seemed to
avoid him timidly, for he had reached a high pitch of anger
and bitterness, and was using his stick very unnecessarily,
and where it fell the blow was no light one. For weeks now
he had not had Heidi all to himself as formerly. When he
came up in the morning the invalid child was always already
in her chair and Heidi fully occupied with her. And it was
the same thing over again when he came down in the evening.
She had not come out with the goats once this summer, and
today she was only coming in company with her friend and
the chair, and would stick by the latter's side the whole time.
It was the thought of this which was making him particularly
cross this morning. There stood the chair on its high wheels.
Peter glared at it as at an enemy that had done him harm
and was likely to do him still more today. He glanced round&mdash;there
was no sound anywhere, no one to see him. He
sprang forward like a wild creature, caught hold of the chair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></span>
and gave it a violent and angry push in the direction of the
slope. It rolled swiftly forward and in another minute had
disappeared.</p>


<p>Peter now sped up the mountain as if on wings, not pausing
till he was well hidden behind a large blackberry bush, for
he had no wish to be seen by Uncle. But he was anxious to
see what had become of the chair, so he looked, and there he
saw his enemy running faster and faster down hill, then it
turned head over heels several times, and finally, after one
great bound, rolled over and over to its complete destruction.
The pieces flew in every direction&mdash;feet, arms, and torn fragments
of the padded seat and bolster&mdash;and Peter experienced
a feeling of such unbounded delight at the sight that he leapt
in the air, laughing aloud and stamping for joy. He could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span>
see only good results for himself in the disaster to his enemy.
Now Heidi's friend would be obliged to go away, for she
would have no means of going about, and when Heidi was
alone again she would come out with him as in the old days,
and everything would go on in the proper way. But Peter
did not consider, or did not know, that when we do a wrong
thing trouble is sure to follow.</p>

<p>Heidi now came running out of the hut and round the
shed. Grandfather was behind with Clara in his arms. The
shed stood wide open, the two loose planks having been taken
down, and it was quite light inside. Heidi looked into every
corner and ran from one end to the other, and then stood still
wondering what could have happened to the chair. Grandfather
now came up.</p>

<p>"How is this, have you wheeled the chair away, Heidi?"</p>

<p>"I have been looking everywhere for it, Grandfather;
you said it was standing ready outside," and she again
searched each corner of the shed with her eyes.</p>

<p>At that moment the wind, which had risen suddenly,
blew open the shed door and sent it banging back against the
wall.</p>

<p>"It must have been the wind, Grandfather," exclaimed
Heidi, and her eyes grew anxious at this sudden discovery.
"Oh! if it has blown the chair all the way down to Doerfli we
shall not get it back in time, and shall not be able to go."</p>

<p>"If it has rolled as far as that it will never come back, for
it is in a hundred pieces by now," said the grandfather, going
round the corner and looking down. "But it's a curious thing
to have happened!" he added as he thought over the matter,
for the chair would have had to turn a corner before starting
down hill.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sorry," lamented Clara, "for we shall not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span>
able to go today, or perhaps any other day. I shall have to
go home, I suppose, if I have no chair. Oh, I am so sorry, I
am so sorry!"</p>

<p>But Heidi looked towards her grandfather with her usual
expression of confidence.</p>

<p>"Grandfather, you will be able to do something, won't
you, so that it need not be as Clara says, and so that she is not
obliged to go home."</p>

<p>"Well, for the present we will go up the mountain as
we had arranged, and then later on we will see what can be
done," he answered, much to the children's delight.</p>

<p>He went indoors, carried out a pile of shawls, and laying
them on the sunniest spot he could find set Clara down upon
them. Then he brought the children's morning milk and led
out his two goats.</p>

<p>"Why is Peter not here yet," thought Uncle to himself,
for Peter's whistle had not been sounded that morning. The
grandfather then took Clara up on one arm, and the shawls
on the other.</p>

<p>"Now then we will start," he said, "the goats can come
with us."</p>

<p>Heidi was pleased at this and walked on after her grandfather
with an arm over either of the goats' necks, and the
animals were so overjoyed to have her again that they nearly
squeezed her flat between them out of sheer affection. When
they reached the spot where the goats usually pastured they
were surprised to find them already feeding there, climbing
about the rocks, and Peter with them, lying his full length
on the ground.</p>

<p>"I'll teach you another time to go by like that, you lazy
rascal! What do you mean by it?" Uncle called to him.</p>

<p>Peter, recognizing the voice, jumped up like a shot. "No
one was up," he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span></p>

<p>"Have you seen anything of the chair?" asked the grandfather.</p>

<p>"Of what chair?" called Peter back in answer in a
morose tone of voice.</p>

<p>Uncle said no more. He spread the shawls on the sunny
slope, and setting Clara upon them asked if she was comfortable.</p>

<p>"As comfortable as in my chair," she said, thanking him,
"and this seems the most beautiful spot. O Heidi, it is lovely,
it is lovely!" she cried, looking round her with delight.</p>

<p>The grandfather prepared to leave them. They would
now be safe and happy together he said, and when it was time
for dinner Heidi was to go and bring the bag from the shady
hollow where he had put it; Peter was to get them as much
milk as they wanted, but Heidi was to see that it was Little
Swan's milk. He would come for them towards evening; he
must now be off to see after the chair and find out what had
become of it.</p>

<p>The sky was dark blue, and not a single cloud was to be
seen from one horizon to the other. The great snowfield overhead
sparkled as if set with thousands and thousands of gold
and silver stars. Now and again a young goat came and lay
down beside them; Snowflake came oftenest, putting her little
head down near Heidi, and only moving because another goat
came and drove her away. And the goats had also grown
familiar with Clara and would rub their heads against her
shoulder, which was always a sign of acquaintanceship and
goodwill.</p>

<p>Some hours went by, and Heidi began to think that she
might just go over to the spot where all the flowers grew to
see if they were fully blown and looking as lovely as the year
before. Clara could not go until grandfather came back that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></span>
evening, when the flowers probably would be already closed.
The longing to go became stronger and stronger, till Heidi felt
she could not resist it.</p>

<p>"Would you think me unkind, Clara," she said rather
hesitatingly, "if I left you for a few minutes? I could run
there and back very quickly. I want so to see how the flowers
are looking&mdash;but wait&mdash;" for an idea had come into Heidi's
head. She ran and picked a bunch or two of green leaves, and
then took hold of Snowflake and led her up to Clara.</p>


<p>"There, now you will not be alone," said Heidi, giving the
goat a little push to show her she was to lie down near Clara,
which the animal quite understood. Heidi threw the leaves
into Clara's lap, and the latter told her friend to go at once to
look at the flowers as she was quite happy to be left with the
goat; she liked this new experience. Heidi ran off, and Clara
began to hold out the leaves one by one to Snowflake, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></span>
snuggled up to her new friend in a confiding manner and
slowly ate the leaves from her hand. She found a strange
new pleasure in sitting all alone like this on the mountain
side, her only companion a little goat that looked to her for
protection. She suddenly felt a great desire to be her own
mistress and to be able to help others, instead of herself being
always dependent as she was now. Many thoughts, unknown
to her before, came crowding into her mind, and a longing to
go on living in the sunshine, and to be doing something that
would bring happiness to another, as now she was helping to
make the goat happy. An unaccustomed feeling of joy took
possession of her, as if everything she had ever known or felt
became all at once more beautiful, and she seemed to see all
things in a new light, and so strong was the sense of this new
beauty and happiness that she threw her arms round the little
goat's neck, and exclaimed, "O Snowflake, how delightful
it is up here! if only I could stay on for ever with you beside
me!"</p>

<p>Heidi had meanwhile reached her field of flowers, and as
she caught sight of it she uttered a cry of joy. The whole
ground in front of her was a mass of shimmering gold, where
the cistus flowers spread their yellow blossoms. Above them
waved whole bushes of the deep blue-bell flowers. Heidi
stood and gazed and drew in the delicious air. Suddenly she
turned round and reached Clara's side out of breath with
running and excitement. "Oh, you must come," she called
out as soon as she came in sight, "it is more beautiful than
you can imagine, and perhaps this evening it may not be so
lovely. I believe I could carry you, don't you think I could?"</p>

<p>Clara looked at her and shook her head. "Why, Heidi,
what can you be thinking of! you are smaller than I am. Oh,
if only I could walk!"</p>

<p>Heidi looked round as if in search of something, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></span>
new idea had evidently come into her head. Peter was sitting
up above looking down on the two children. He had
been sitting and staring before him in the same way for
hours, as if he could not make out what he saw. He had destroyed
the chair so that the friend might not be able to move
anywhere and that her visit might come to an end, and then
a little while after she had appeared right up here under his
very nose with Heidi beside her. He thought his eyes must
deceive him, and yet there she was and no mistake about it.</p>

<p>Heidi looked up to where he was sitting and called out in
a commanding voice, "Peter, come down here!"</p>

<p>"I don't wish to come," he called in reply.</p>

<p>"But you must; I cannot do it alone, and you must come
here and help me; make haste and come down," she called
again in an urgent voice.</p>

<p>"I shall do nothing of the kind," was the answer.</p>

<p>Heidi ran some way up the slope towards him, and then
pausing called again, her eyes ablaze with anger, "If you
don't come at once, Peter, I will do something to you that you
won't like; I mean what I say."</p>

<p>Peter felt an inward throe at these words, and a great
fear seized him. He had done something wicked which he
wanted no one to know about, and so far he had thought himself
safe. But now Heidi spoke exactly as if she knew everything,
and whatever she did know she would tell her grandfather,
and there was no one he feared so much as this latter
person. Supposing he were to suspect what had happened
about the chair! Peter's anguish of mind grew more acute.
He stood up and went down to where Heidi was awaiting him.</p>

<p>"I am coming, and you won't do what you said."</p>

<p>Peter appeared now so submissive with fear that Heidi
felt quite sorry for him and answered assuringly, "No, no, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span>
course not; come along with me, there is nothing to be afraid
of in what I want you to do."</p>

<p>As soon as they got to Clara, Heidi gave her orders:
Peter was to take hold of her under the arms on one side and
she on the other, and together they were to lift her up. This
first movement was successfully carried through, but then
came the difficulty. As Clara could not even stand, how were
they to support her and get her along? Heidi was too small
for her arm to serve Clara to lean upon.</p>

<p>"You must put one arm well round my neck&mdash;so, and
put the other through Peter's and lean firmly upon it, then
we shall be able to carry you."</p>

<p>Peter, however, had never given his arm to any one in
his life. Clara put hers in his, but he kept his own hanging
down straight beside him like a stick.</p>

<p>"That's not the way, Peter," said Heidi in an authoritative
voice. "You must put your arm out in the shape of a
ring, and Clara must put hers through it and lean her weight
upon you, and whatever you do, don't let your arm give way;
like that I am sure we shall be able to manage."</p>

<p>Peter did as he was told, but still they did not get on very
well. Clara was not such a light weight, and the team did not
match very well in size; it was up one side and down the
other, so that the supports were rather wabbly.</p>

<p>Clara tried to use her own feet a little, but each time drew
them quickly back.</p>

<p>"Put your foot down firmly once," suggested Heidi, "I
am sure it will hurt you less after that."</p>

<p>"Do you think so," said Clara hesitatingly, but she followed
Heidi's advice and ventured one firm step on the
ground and then another; she called out a little as she did it;
then she lifted her foot again and went on, "Oh, that was less
painful already," she exclaimed joyfully.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></span></p>

<p>"Try again," said Heidi encouragingly.</p>

<p>And Clara went on putting one foot out after another until
all at once she called out, "I can do it, Heidi! look! look! I
can make proper steps!"</p>

<p>And Heidi cried out with even greater delight, "Can you
really make steps, can you really walk? really walk by yourself?
Oh, if only grandfather were here!" and she continued
gleefully to exclaim, "You can walk now, Clara, you
can walk!"</p>

<p>Clara still held on firmly to her supports, but with every
step she felt safer on her feet, as all three became aware, and
Heidi was beside herself with joy.</p>

<p>"Now we shall be able to come up here together every
day, and just go where we like; and you will be able to walk
about as I do, and not have to be pushed in a chair, and will
get quite strong and well. It is the greatest happiness we
could have had!"</p>

<p>And Clara heartily agreed, for she could think of no
greater joy in the world than to be strong and able to go about
like other people, and no longer to have to lie from day to day
in her invalid chair.</p>

<p>They had not far to go to reach the field of flowers, and
could already catch sight of the cistus flowers' glowing gold
in the sun. As they came to the bushes of the blue-bell flowers,
with sunny, inviting patches of warm ground between
them, Clara said, "Can't we sit down here for a while?"</p>

<p>This was just what Heidi enjoyed, and so the children sat
down in the midst of the flowers, Clara for the first time on
the dry, warm mountain grass, and she found it indescribably
delightful. Everything was so lovely! so lovely! And Heidi,
who was beside her, thought she had never seen it so perfectly
beautiful up here before. Then she suddenly remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></span>
that Clara was cured; that was the crowning delight of all
that made life so delightful in the midst of all this surrounding
beauty. Clara sat silent, overcome with the enchantment
of all that her eye rested upon, and with the anticipation of all
the happiness that was now before her. There seemed hardly
room in her heart for all her joyful emotions.</p>

<p>Peter also lay among the flowers without moving or
speaking, for he was fast asleep. The breeze came blowing
softly and caressingly from behind the sheltering rocks, and
passed whisperingly through the bushes overhead. Heidi
got up now and then to run about, for the flowers waving in
the warm wind seemed to smell sweeter and to grow more
thickly whichever way she went. So the hours went by.</p>

<p>It was long past noon when a small troop of goats advanced
solemnly towards the plain of flowers. It was not a
feeding place of theirs, for they did not care to graze on
flowers. They looked like an embassy arriving, with Greenfinch
as their leader. They had evidently come in search of
their companions who had left them in the lurch, and who had
remained away so long, for the goats could tell the time without
mistake. As soon as Greenfinch caught sight of the three
missing friends amid the flowers she set up an extra loud
bleat, whereupon all the others joined in a chorus of bleats,
and the whole company came trotting towards the children.
Peter woke up, rubbing his eyes, for he had been dreaming
that he saw the chair again with its beautiful red padding
standing whole and uninjured before the grandfather's door.
He experienced again the dreadful fear of mind that he had
lost in this dream of the uninjured chair. Even though Heidi
had promised not to do anything, there still remained the
lively dread that his deed might be found out in some other
way. He allowed Heidi to do what she liked with him, for he
was reduced to such a state of low spirits and meekness that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></span>
he was ready to give his help to Clara without murmur or
resistance.</p>

<p>When all three had got back to their old quarters Heidi
ran and brought forward the bag, and proceeded to fulfill her
promise, for her threat of the morning had been concerned
with Peter's dinner. She had seen her grandfather putting in
all sorts of good things, and had been pleased to think of
Peter having a large share of them, and she had meant him to
understand when he refused at first to help her that he would
get nothing for his dinner, but Peter's conscience had put
another interpretation upon her words. Heidi took the food
out of the bag and divided it into three portions, and each was
of such a goodly size that she thought to herself, "There will
be plenty of ours left for him to have more still."</p>

<p>She gave the other two their dinners and sat down with
her own beside Clara, and they all three ate with a good
appetite after their great exertions.</p>

<p>Peter ate up every bit of food to the last crumb, but there
was something wanting to his usual enjoyment of a good dinner,
for every mouthful he swallowed seemed to choke him,
and he felt something gnawing inside him.</p>

<p>They were so late at their dinner that they had not long
to wait after they had finished before grandfather came up
to get them. Heidi rushed forward to meet him as soon as he
appeared, as she wanted to be the first to tell him the good
news. She was so excited that she could hardly get her words
out when she did get up to him, but he soon understood, and
a look of extreme pleasure came into his face. He hastened
up to where Clara was sitting and said with a cheerful smile,
"So, we've made the effort, have we, and won the day!"</p>


<p>Then he lifted her up, and putting his left arm behind
her and giving her his right to lean upon, made her walk a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a></span>
way, which she did with less trembling and hesitation than
before, now that she had such a strong arm round her.</p>

<p>Heidi skipped along beside her in glee, and the grandfather
looked too as if some happiness had befallen him. "We
must not overdo it," he said taking Clara up in his arms. "It
is high time we went home," and he started off down the
mountain path, for he was anxious to get her indoors that she
might rest after her unusual fatigue.</p>

<p>When Peter got to Doerfli that evening he found a large
group of people collected round a certain spot, pushing one
another and looking over each other's shoulders in their eagerness
to catch sight of something lying on the ground.
Peter thought he should like to see too, and poked and elbowed
till he made his way through.</p>

<p>There it lay, the thing he had wanted to see. Scattered
about the grass were the remains of Clara's chair; part of the
back and the middle bit, and enough of the red padding and
the bright nails to show how magnificent the chair had been
when it was entire.</p>

<p>"I was here when the men passed carrying it up," said
the baker, who was standing near Peter. "I'll bet any one
that it was worth 125 dollars at least. I cannot think how
such an accident could have happened."</p>

<p>"Uncle said the wind might perhaps have done it," remarked
one of the women.</p>

<p>"It's a good job that no one but the wind did it," said the
baker again, "or he might smart for it! No doubt the gentleman
in Frankfurt when he hears what has happened will
make inquiries about it. I am glad for myself that I have not
been seen up the mountain for a good two years, as suspicion
is likely to fall on any one who was up there at the time."</p>

<p>Many more opinions were passed on the matter, but Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></span>
had heard enough. He crept quietly away out of the crowd
and then took to his heels and ran up home as fast as he could,
as if he thought some one was after him. The baker's words
had filled him with fear and trembling. He was sure now
that any day a constable might come over from Frankfurt and
inquire about the destruction of the chair, and then everything
would come out, and he would be seized and carried off
to Frankfurt and there put in prison.</p>

<p>He reached home in this disturbed state of mind. He
would not open his mouth in reply to anything that was said
to him; he would not eat his potatoes; all he did was to creep
off to bed as quickly as possible and hide under the bedclothes
and groan.</p>

<p>"Peter has been eating sorrel again, and is evidently in
pain by the way he is groaning," said his mother.</p>

<p>"You must give him a little more bread to take with
him; give him a bit of mine tomorrow," said the grandmother
sympathizingly.</p>

<p>As the children lay that night in bed looking out at the
stars Heidi said, "I have been thinking all day what a happy
thing it is that God does not give us what we ask for, even
when we pray and pray and pray, if He knows there is something
better for us; have you felt like that?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask me that tonight all of a sudden?" asked
Clara.</p>

<p>"Because I prayed so hard when I was in Frankfurt that
I might go home at once, and because I was not allowed to I
thought God had forgotten me. And now you see, if I had
come away at first when I wanted to, you would never have
come here, and would never have got well."</p>

<p>Clara had in her turn become thoughtful. "But, Heidi,"
she began again, "in that case we ought never to pray for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></span>
anything, as God always intends something better for us than
we know or wish for."</p>

<p>"You must not think it is like that, Clara," replied Heidi
eagerly. "We must go on praying for everything, so that
God may know we do not forget that it all comes from Him.
If we forget God, then He lets us go our own way and we get
into trouble."</p>

<p>"How did you learn all that?" asked Clara.</p>

<p>"Grandmamma explained it to me first of all, and then
when it all happened just as she said, I knew it myself, and I
think, Clara," she went on, as she sat up in bed, "we ought
certainly to thank God tonight that you can walk now, and
that He has made us so happy."</p>

<p>"Yes, Heidi, I am sure you are right, and I am glad you
reminded me; I almost forgot my prayers for very joy."</p>

<p>Both children said their prayers, and each thanked God
in her own way for the blessing He had bestowed on Clara,
who had for so long lain weak and ill.</p>

<p>The next morning the grandfather suggested that they
should now write to the grandmamma and ask her if she would
not come and pay them a visit, as they had something new to
show her. But the children had another plan in their heads,
for they wanted to prepare a great surprise for grandmamma.
Clara was first to have more practice in walking so that she
might be able to go a little way by herself; above all things
grandmamma was not to have a hint of it. They asked the
grandfather how long he thought this would take, and when
he told them about a week or less, they immediately sat down
and wrote a pressing invitation to grandmamma, asking her
to come soon, but no word was said about there being anything
new to see.</p>

<p>The following days were some of the most joyous that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a></span>
Clara had spent on the mountain. She awoke each morning
with a happy voice within her crying, "I am well now! I am
well now! I shan't have to go about in a chair, I can walk by
myself like other people."</p>

<p>Then came the walking, and every day she found it easier
and was able to go a longer distance. The movement gave
her such an appetite that the grandfather cut his bread and
butter a little thicker each day, and was well pleased to see it
disappear. He brought out the foaming milk in a larger jug
so he could fill the little bowls over and over again. And so
another week went by and the day came which was to bring
grandmamma up the mountain for her second visit.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">G<span class="smcap">randmamma</span> wrote the day before her arrival to let
the children know that they might expect her without
fail. Peter brought up the letter early the following morning.
As he neared the group his steps slackened, and the instant
he had handed the letter to Uncle he turned quickly away as
if frightened and ran off up the mountain.</p>

<p>"Grandfather," said Heidi, who had been watching him
with astonished eyes, "why does Peter always behave now
like the Great Turk when he thinks somebody is after him
with a stick; he turns and shakes his head and goes off with a
bound just like that?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps Peter fancies he sees the stick which he so well
deserves coming after him," answered grandfather.</p>

<p>Heidi set about tidying the hut, as grandmamma must
find everything clean and in good order when she arrived.</p>

<p>Clara looked on amused and interested to watch the busy
Heidi at her work.</p>

<p>Then the children dressed up and went and sat together
outside on the seat ready to receive her.</p>

<p>At last they saw the procession winding up the mountain
just in the order they had expected. First there was the
guide, then the white horse with grandmamma mounted upon
it, and last of all the porter with a heavy bundle on his back,
for grandmamma would not think of going up the mountain
without a full supply of wraps and rugs.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer wound the procession; at last it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a></span>
reached the top and grandmamma was there looking down on
the children from her horse. She no sooner saw them, however,
sitting side by side, than she began quickly dismounting,
as she cried out in a shocked tone of voice, "Why is this?
why are you not lying in your chair, Clara? What are you
all thinking about?" But even before she had got close to
them she threw up her hands in astonishment, exclaiming
further, "Is it really you, dear child? Why, your cheeks have
grown quite round and rosy! I should hardly have known
you again!" And she was hastening forward to embrace
her, when Heidi slipped down from the seat, and with Clara
leaning on her shoulder, began walking along quite coolly and
naturally. Then indeed grandmamma was surprised, or
rather alarmed, for she thought at first that it must be some
unheard-of proceeding of Heidi's.</p>

<p>But no&mdash;Clara was actually walking steadily and uprightly
beside Heidi. Laughing and crying she ran to them
and embraced first Clara and then Heidi, and then Clara
again, unable to speak for joy. All at once she caught sight
of Uncle standing by the seat and looking on smiling at the
meeting. She went up to the old man and seized his hands.</p>

<p>"My dear Uncle! my dear Uncle! how much we have to
thank you for! It is all your doing! it is your care and
nursing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And God's good sun and mountain air," he interrupted
her smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes, and don't forget the beautiful milk I have," put in
Clara. "Grandmamma, you can't think what a quantity of
goat's milk I drink, and how nice it is!"</p>

<p>"I can see that by your cheeks, child," answered grandmamma.
"I really should not have known you; you have
grown quite strong and plump, and taller too; I never hoped
or expected to see you look like that. I cannot take my eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a></span>
off you, for I can hardly yet believe it. But now I must telegraph
without delay to my son in Paris, and tell him he must
come here at once. I shall not say why; it will be the greatest
happiness he has ever known. My dear Uncle, how can I send
a telegram; have you dismissed the men yet?"</p>

<p>"They have gone," he answered, "but if you are in a
hurry I will get Peter, and he can take it for you."</p>

<p>Grandmamma thanked him, for she was anxious that the
good news should not be kept from her son a day longer than
was possible.</p>

<p>So Uncle went aside a little way and blew such a resounding
whistle through his fingers that he awoke a responsive
echo among the rocks far overhead. He did not have to
wait many minutes before Peter came running down in
answer, for he knew the sound of Uncle's whistle. Peter
looked as white as a ghost, for he thought Uncle was sending
for him to give him up. But instead he only gave him a
written paper with instructions to take it down at once to the
post-office at Doerfli; Uncle would settle for the payment
later, as it was not safe to give Peter too much to look after.</p>

<p>Peter went off with the paper in his hand, feeling some
relief of mind for the present, for as Uncle had not whistled
for him in order to give him up it was evident that no policeman
had yet arrived.</p>

<p>So now they all sat down in peace to their dinner round
the table in front of the hut, and grandmamma was given a
detailed account of all that had taken place. How grandfather
had made Clara try first to stand and then to move her
feet a little every day, and how they had settled for the day's
excursion up the mountain and the chair had been blown
away. How Clara's desire to see the flowers had induced her
to take the first walk, and so by degrees one thing had led to
another. The recital took some time, for grandmamma continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a></span>
interrupted it with fresh exclamations of surprise
and thankfulness: "It hardly seems possible! I can scarcely
believe it is not all a dream! Are we really awake, and are we
all sitting here by the mountain hut, and is that round-faced,
healthy-looking child my poor little, white, sickly Clara?"</p>

<p>And Clara and Heidi could not get over their delight at
the success of the surprise they had so carefully arranged for
grandmamma and at the latter's continued astonishment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Sesemann, who had finished his business
in Paris, had also been preparing a surprise. Without saying
a word to his mother he got into the train one sunny morning
and travelled that day to Basle; the next morning he continued
his journey, for a great longing had seized him to see his little
daughter from whom he had been separated the whole summer.
He arrived at Ragatz a few hours after his mother had
left. When he heard that she had that very day started for
the mountain, he immediately hired a carriage and drove as
far as Doerfli, and then started to climb the mountain. He
went on and on, but still no hut came in sight, and yet he knew
there was one where Peter lived half way up, for the path had
been described to him over and over again.</p>

<p>He began to wonder if he was on the right path, and
whether the hut lay perhaps on the other side of the mountain.
He looked round to see if any one was in sight of whom
he could ask the way; but far and wide there was not a soul
to be seen nor a sound to be heard. Only at moments the
mountain wind whistled through the air, and the insects
hummed in the sunshine, or a happy bird sang out from the
branches of a solitary larch tree. Mr. Sesemann stood still
for a while to let the cool Alpine wind blow on his hot face.
But now some one came running down the mountainside&mdash;it
was Peter with the telegram in his hand. He ran straight
down the steep slope, not following the path on which Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a></span>
Sesemann was standing. As soon as the latter caught sight
of him he beckoned to him to come. Peter advanced towards
him slowly and timidly, with a sort of sidelong movement, as
if he could only move one leg properly and had to drag the
other after him.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, lad," he called, and when Peter was near
enough, "Tell me," he said, "is this the way to the hut where
the old man and the child Heidi live, and where the visitors
from Frankfurt are staying?"</p>

<p>A low sound of fear was the only answer he received, as
Peter turned to run away in such precipitous haste that he
fell head over heels several times, and went rolling and bumping
down the slope in involuntary bounds, just in the same
way as the chair, only that Peter fortunately did not fall to
pieces as that had done. Only the telegram came to grief, and
that was torn into fragments and flew away.</p>

<p>"How extraordinarily timid these mountain dwellers
are!" thought Mr. Sesemann to himself, for he quite believed
that it was the sight of a stranger that had made such an impression
on this unsophisticated child of the mountains.</p>

<p>After watching Peter's violent descent towards the valley
for a few minutes he continued his journey.</p>

<p>Peter, meanwhile, with all his efforts, could not stop himself,
but went rolling on, and still tumbling head over heels
at intervals in a most remarkable manner.</p>


<p>But this was not the most terrible part of his sufferings
at the moment, for far worse was the fear and horror that
possessed him, feeling sure, as he did now, that the policeman
had really come over for him from Frankfurt. He had no
doubt at all that the stranger who had asked him the way was
the very man himself. Just as he had rolled to the edge of the
last high slope above Doerfli he was caught in a bush, and at
last able to keep himself from falling any farther. He lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a></span>
still for a second or two to recover himself, and to think over
matters.</p>

<p>"Well done! another of you come bumping along like
this!" said a voice close to Peter, "and which of you tomorrow
is the wind going to send rolling down like a badly-sewn sack
of potatoes?" It was the baker, who stood there laughing.
He had been strolling out to refresh himself after his hot
day's work, and had watched with amusement as he saw
Peter come rolling over and over in much the same way as
the chair.</p>

<p>Peter was on his feet in a moment. He had received a
fresh shock. Without once looking behind him he began
hurrying up the slope again. He would have liked best to go
home and creep into bed, so as to hide himself, for he felt
safest when there. But he had left the goats up above, and
Uncle had given him strict injunctions to make haste back so
that they might not be left too long alone. And he stood more
in awe of Uncle than any one, and would not have dared to
disobey him on any account. There was no help for it, he had
to go back, and Peter went on groaning and limping. He
could run no more, for the anguish of mind he had been
through, and the bumping and shaking he had received, were
beginning to tell upon him. And so with lagging steps and
groans he slowly made his way up the mountain.</p>

<p>Shortly after meeting Peter, Mr. Sesemann passed the
first hut, and so was satisfied that he was on the right path.
He continued his climb with renewed courage, and at last,
after a long and exhausting walk, he came in sight of his goal.
There, only a little distance farther up, stood the grandfather's
home, with the dark tops of the fir trees waving above
its roof.</p>

<p>Mr. Sesemann was delighted to have come to the last
steep bit of his journey, in another minute or two he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a></span>
be with his little daughter, and he pleased himself with the
thought of her surprise. But the company above had seen his
approaching figure and recognized who it was, and they were
preparing something he little expected as a surprise on their
part.</p>

<p>As he stepped on to the space in front of the hut two
figures came towards him. One a tall girl with fair hair and
pink cheeks, leaning on Heidi, whose dark eyes were dancing
with joy. Mr. Sesemann suddenly stopped, staring at the
two children, and all at once the tears started to his eyes.
What memories arose in his heart! Just so had Clara's mother
looked, the fair-haired girl with the delicate pink-and-white
complexion. He did not know if he was awake or dreaming.</p>

<p>"Don't you know me, Papa?" called Clara to him, her
face beaming with happiness. "Am I so altered since you
saw me?"</p>

<p>Then the father ran to his child and clasped her in his
arms.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are indeed altered! How is it possible? Is it
true what I see?" And the delighted man stepped back to
look full at her again, and to make sure that the picture would
not vanish before his eyes.</p>

<p>"Are you my little Clara, really my little Clara?" he
kept on saying, then he clasped her in his arms again, and
again put her away from him that he might look and make
sure it was she who stood before him.</p>

<p>Then grandmamma came up, anxious for a sight of her
son's happy face.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you say now, dear son?" she exclaimed.
"You have given us a pleasant surprise, but it is nothing in
comparison to what we have prepared for you, you must confess,"
and she gave her son an affectionate kiss as she spoke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></span>
"But now," she went on, "you must come and pay your
respects to Uncle, who is our chief benefactor."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, and our little Heidi, too," said Mr. Sesemann,
shaking Heidi by the hand. "Well? are you quite well
and happy in your mountain home? but I need not ask, no
Alpine rose could look more blooming. I am glad, child, it is
a pleasure to me to see you so."</p>

<p>And Heidi looked up with equal pleasure into his kind
face. How good he had always been to her! And that he
should find such happiness awaiting him up here on the
mountain made her heart beat with gladness.</p>

<p>Grandmamma introduced him to Uncle, and while the
two men were shaking hands and Mr. Sesemann was expressing
his heartfelt thanks and boundless astonishment to
the old man, grandmamma wandered round to the back to see
the old fir trees again.</p>

<p>Here another unexpected sight met her gaze, for there,
under the trees stood a great bush of the most wonderful dark
blue gentians, as fresh and shining as if they were growing on
the spot.</p>

<p>"How exquisite! what a lovely sight!" she exclaimed.
"Heidi, dearest child, come here! Is it you who have prepared
this pleasure for me? It is perfectly wonderful!"</p>

<p>The children ran up.</p>

<p>"No, no, I did not put them there," said Heidi, "but I
know who did."</p>

<p>"They grow just like that on the mountain, Grandmamma,
only if anything they look more beautiful still,"
Clara put in; "but guess who brought those down today,"
and as she spoke she gave such a pleased smile that the grandmother
thought for a moment the child herself must have
gathered them. But that was hardly possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></span></p>

<p>At this moment a slight rustling was heard behind the fir
trees. It was Peter, who had just arrived. He had made a
long round, trying to slip by unobserved. But grandmamma
had seen and recognized him, and suddenly the thought struck
her that it might be Peter who had brought the flowers and
that he was now trying to get away unseen, feeling shy about
it; but she could not let him go off like that, he must have
some little reward.</p>

<p>"Come along, boy; come here, do not be afraid," she
called to him.</p>

<p>Peter stood still, petrified with fear. After all he had
gone through that day he felt he had no longer any power of
resistance left. All he could think was, "It's all up with me
now." Every hair of his head stood on end, and he stepped
forth from behind the fir trees, his face pale.</p>

<p>"Courage, boy," said grandmamma in her effort to dispel
his shyness, "tell me now straight out without hesitation,
was it you who did it?"</p>

<p>Peter did not lift his eyes and therefore did not see at
what grandmamma was pointing. But he knew that Uncle
was standing at the corner of the hut, fixing him with his grey
eyes, while beside him stood the most terrible person that
Peter could conceive&mdash;the police-constable from Frankfurt.
Quaking in every limb, and with trembling lips he muttered a
low "Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, and what is there dreadful about that?" said
grandmamma.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because&mdash;it is all broken to pieces and no one
can put it together again." Peter brought out his words
with difficulty, and his knees knocked together so that he
could hardly stand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a></span></p>

<p>Grandmamma went up to Uncle. "Is that poor boy a little
out of his mind?" she asked sympathizingly.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," Uncle assured her, "it is only that he
was the wind that sent the chair rolling down the slope, and
he is expecting his well-deserved punishment."</p>

<p>Grandmamma found this hard to believe, for in her
opinion Peter did not look an entirely bad boy, nor could he
have had any reason for destroying such a necessary thing as
the chair. But Uncle had only given expression to the suspicion
that he had had from the moment the accident happened.
The angry looks which Peter had from the beginning
cast at Clara, and the other signs of his dislike to what had
been taking place on the mountain, had not escaped Uncle's
eye. Putting two and two together he had come to the right
conclusion as to the cause of the disaster, and he therefore
spoke without hesitation when he accused Peter. The lady
broke out into lively expostulations on hearing this.</p>

<p>"No, no, dear Uncle, we will not punish the poor boy any
further. One must be fair to him. Here are all these strangers
from Frankfurt who come and carry away Heidi, his one
sole possession, and a possession well worth having too, and
he is left to sit alone day after day for weeks, with nothing to
do but brood over his wrongs. No, no, let us be fair to him;
his anger got the upper hand and drove him to an act of revenge&mdash;a
foolish one, I own, but then we all behave foolishly
when we are angry." And saying this she went back to
Peter, who still stood frightened and trembling. She sat
down on the seat under the fir trees and called him to her
kindly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come here, boy, and stand in front of me, for I have
something to say to you. Leave off shaking and trembling,
for I want you to listen to me. You sent the chair rolling
down the mountain so that it was broken to pieces. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></span>
was a very wrong thing to do, as you yourself knew very well
at the time, and you also knew that you deserved to be punished
for it. But be sure of this, Peter: that those who do
wrong make a mistake when they think no one knows anything
about it. For God sees and hears everything, and when
the wicked doer tries to hide what he has done, then God
wakes up the little watchman that He places inside us all when
we are born and who sleeps on quietly till we do something
wrong. And the little watchman has a small goad in his
hand, and when he wakes up he keeps on pricking us with it,
so that we have not a moment's peace. And the watchman
torments us still further, for he keeps on calling out, 'Now you
will be found out! Now they will drag you off to punishment!'
And so we pass our life in fear and trouble, and never
know a moment's happiness or peace. Have you not felt
something like that lately, Peter?"</p>

<p>Peter gave a contrite nod of the head, as one who knew
all about it, for grandmamma had described his own feelings
exactly.</p>

<p>"And you calculated wrongly also in another way," continued
grandmamma, "for you see the harm you intended has
turned out for the best for those you wished to hurt. As
Clara had no chair to go in and yet wanted so much to see the
flowers, she made the effort to walk, and every day since she
has been walking better and better. Do not forget my words,
and whenever you feel inclined to do anything wrong, think
of the little watchman inside you with his goad and his disagreeable
voice. Will you remember all this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will," answered Peter, still very subdued, for he
did not yet know how the matter was going to end, as the
police-constable was still standing with the Uncle.</p>

<p>"That's right, and now the thing is over and done for,"
said grandmamma. "But I should like you to have something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a></span>
for a pleasant reminder of the visitors from Frankfurt.
Can you tell me anything that you have wished very much
to have? What would you like best as a present?"</p>

<p>Peter lifted his head at this, and stared open-eyed at
grandmamma. Up to the last minute he had been expecting
something dreadful to happen, and now he might have anything
that he wanted. His mind seemed all of a whirl.</p>

<p>"I mean what I say," went on grandmamma. "You shall
choose what you would like to have as a remembrance from
the Frankfurt visitors, and as a token that they will not think
any more of the wrong thing you did. Now do you understand
me, boy?"</p>

<p>The fact began at last to dawn upon Peter's mind that
he had no further punishment to fear, and that the kind lady
sitting in front of him had delivered him from the police-constable.
He suddenly felt as if the weight of a mountain
had fallen off him. He had also by this time awakened to the
further conviction that it was better to make a full confession
at once of anything he had done wrong or had left undone,
and so he said, "And I lost the paper, too."</p>

<p>Grandmamma had to consider a moment what he meant,
but soon recalled his connection with her telegram, and
answered kindly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are a good boy to tell me! Never conceal anything
you have done wrong, and then all will come right again.
And now what would you like me to give you?"</p>

<p>Peter grew almost giddy with the thought that he could
have anything in the world that he wished for. He had a
vision of the yearly fair at Mayenfeld with the glittering
booths and all the lovely things that he had stood gazing at for
hours, without a hope of ever possessing one of them, for
Peter's purse never held more than five cents, and all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></span>
fascinating objects cost double that amount. There were the
pretty little red whistles that he could use to call his goats,
and the splendid knives with rounded handles, known as
toad-strikers, with which one could do such fine whittling.</p>

<p>Peter remained pondering; he was trying to think which
of these two desirable objects he should best like to have, and
he found it difficult to decide. Then a bright thought occurred
to him; he would then be able to think over the matter between
now and next year's fair.</p>

<p>"A dime," answered Peter, who was no longer in doubt.</p>

<p>Grandmamma could not help laughing. "That is not an
extravagant request. Come here then!" and she pulled out
her purse and put four bright silver dollars in his hand and
then laid some dimes on the top of them. "We will settle our
accounts at once," she continued, "and I will explain them to
you. I have given you as many dimes as there are weeks in
the year, and so every Sunday throughout the year you can
take out a dime to spend."</p>

<p>"As long as I live?" said Peter quite innocently.</p>

<p>Grandmamma laughed more still at this, and the men
hearing her, paused in their talk to listen to what was going
on.</p>

<p>"Yes, boy, you shall have it all your life&mdash;I will put it
down in my will. Do you hear, my son? and you are to put it
down in yours as well: a dime a week to Peter as long as he
lives."</p>

<p>Mr. Sesemann nodded his assent and joined in the
laughter.</p>

<p>Peter looked again at the present in his hand to make
sure he was not dreaming, and then said, "Thank God!"</p>

<p>And he went off running and leaping with more even
than his usual agility, and this time managed to keep his feet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a></span>
for it was not fear, but joy such as he had never known before
in his life, that now sent him flying up the mountain. All
trouble and trembling had disappeared, and he was to have
a dime every week for life.</p>

<p>Later, after dinner, when the party were sitting together
chatting, Clara drew her father a little aside, and said with
an eagerness that had been unknown to the little, tired invalid,&mdash;</p>

<p>"O papa, if you only knew all that grandfather has done
for me from day to day! I cannot reckon his kindnesses, but I
shall never forget them as long as I live! And I keep on
thinking what I could do for him, or what present I could
make him that would give him half as much pleasure as he
has given me."</p>

<p>"That is just what I wish most myself, Clara," replied
her father, whose face grew happier each time he looked at his
little daughter. "I have been also thinking how we can best
show our gratitude to our good benefactor."</p>

<p>Mr. Sesemann went over to Uncle and taking him by
the hand said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear friend, you will believe me when I tell you that I
have known no real happiness for years past. What good
were money and property to me when they were unable to
make my poor child well and happy? With the help of God
you have made her whole and strong, and you have given new
life not only to her but to me. Tell me now, in what way can I
show my gratitude to you? I can never repay all you have
done, but whatever is in my power to do is at your service.
Speak, friend, and tell me what I can do?"</p>

<p>Uncle had listened to him quietly, with a smile of pleasure
on his face as he looked at the happy father.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sesemann," he replied in his dignified way, "I too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a></span>
have my share in the joy of your daughter's recovery, and my
trouble is well repaid by it. I thank you heartily for all you
have said, but I have need of nothing; I have enough for myself
and the child as long as I live. Of course, I am growing
old, and shall not be here much longer. I have nothing to
leave the child when I die. If you could promise me that
Heidi will never have to earn her living among strangers,
then you would richly reward me for all I have done for your
child."</p>

<p>"There could never be any question of such a thing as
that, my dear friend," said Mr. Sesemann quickly. "I look
upon the child as my own. Ask my mother, my daughter; you
may be sure that they will never allow the child to be left in
any one else's care! But if it will make you happier I give
you here my hand upon it. I promise you: Heidi shall
never have to go and earn her living among strangers; I will
make provision against this both during my life and after.
But now I have something else to say. Independent of her
circumstances, the child is totally unfitted to live a life away
from home; we found that out when she was with us. But she
has made friends, and among them I know one who is at this
moment in Frankfurt; he is winding up his affairs there, that
he may be free to go where he likes and take his rest. I am
speaking of my friend, the doctor, who came over here in the
autumn and who, having well considered your advice, intends
to settle in this neighborhood, for he has never felt so well
and happy anywhere as in the company of you and Heidi. So
you see the child will henceforth have two protectors near her&mdash;and
may they both live long to share the task!"</p>


<p>"God grant indeed it may be so!" added grandmamma,
shaking Uncle's hand warmly as she spoke, to show how
sincerely she echoed her son's wish. Then putting her arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a></span>
round Heidi, who was standing near, she drew the child to
her.</p>

<p>"And I have a question to ask you too, dear Heidi. Tell
me if there is anything you particularly wish for?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there is," answered Heidi promptly, looking up
delightedly at grandmamma.</p>

<p>"Then tell me at once, dear, what it is."</p>

<p>"I want to have the bed I slept in at Frankfurt with the
high pillows and thick coverlid, and then grandmother will
not have to lie with her head down hill and hardly able to
breathe, and she will be warm enough under the coverlid not
to have to wear her shawl in bed to prevent her freezing to
death."</p>

<p>In her eagerness to obtain what she had set her heart
upon Heidi hardly gave herself time to get out all she had to
say, and did not pause for breath till she reached the end of
her sentence.</p>

<p>"Dearest child," answered grandmamma, moved by
Heidi's speech, "what is this you tell me of grandmother!
You are right to remind me. In the midst of our own happiness
we forget too often that which we ought to remember
before all things. When God has shown us some special
mercy we should think at once of those who are denied so
many things. I will telegraph to Frankfurt at once! Miss
Rottermeyer shall pack up the bed this very day, and it will
be here in two days' time. God willing, grandmother shall
soon be sleeping comfortably upon it."</p>

<p>Heidi skipped round grandmamma in her glee, and then
stopping all of a sudden, said quickly, "I must make haste
down and tell her."</p>

<p>"No, no, Heidi, what can you be thinking of," said her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a></span>
grandfather reprovingly. "You can't be running backwards
and forwards like that when you have visitors."</p>

<p>But grandmamma interfered on Heidi's behalf. "The
child is not so far wrong, Uncle," she said, "and poor grandmother
has too long been deprived of Heidi for our sakes. Let
us all go down to her together. I believe my horse is waiting
for me and I can ride down from there, and as soon as I get to
Doerfli the message shall be sent off. What do you think of
my plan, son?"</p>

<p>Mr. Sesemann had not yet had time to speak of his
travelling plans, so he begged his mother to wait a few moments
that he might tell her what he proposed doing.</p>

<p>Mr. Sesemann had been arranging that he and his
mother should make a little tour in Switzerland, first ascertaining
if Clara was in a fit state to go some part of the
way with them. But now he would have the full enjoyment
of his daughter's company, and that being so he did not want
to miss any of these beautiful days of later summer, but to
start at once on the journey that he now looked forward to
with such additional pleasure. And so he proposed that they
should spend the night in Doerfli and that next day he should
come and get Clara, then they would all three go down to
Ragatz and make that their starting point.</p>

<p>Clara was rather upset at first at the thought of saying
good-bye like this to the mountain; she could not help being
pleased, however, at the prospect of another journey, and no
time was allowed her to give way to lamentation.</p>

<p>Grandmamma had already taken Heidi by the hand, preparatory
to leading the way, when she suddenly turned. "But
what is to become of Clara?" she asked, remembering all at
once that the child could not yet take so long a walk. She
gave a nod of satisfaction as she saw that Uncle had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></span>
taken Clara up in his arms and was following her with sturdy
strides. Mr. Sesemann brought up the rear, and so they all
started down the mountain.</p>

<p>Heidi kept jumping for joy as she and Mrs. Sesemann
walked along side by side, and grandmamma asked all about
Peter's grandmother, how she lived, and what she did, especially
in the winter when it was so cold. And Heidi gave
her a minute account of everything, for she knew all that
went on at grandmother's, and told her how the old woman
sat crouching in her corner and trembling with cold. She was
able also to give her exact particulars of what grandmother
had and had not to eat. Grandmamma listened with interest
and sympathy until they came to grandmother's. Brigitta
was just hanging out Peter's second shirt in the sun, so that
he might have it ready to put on when he had worn the other
long enough. As soon as she saw the company approaching
she rushed indoors.</p>

<p>"The whole party of them are just going past, mother,
evidently all returning home again," she informed the old
woman. "Uncle is with them, carrying the sick child."</p>

<p>"Alas, it is really to be so then?" sighed the grandmother.
"And you saw Heidi with them? Then they are
taking her away. If only she could come and put her hand in
mine again! If I could but hear her voice once more!"</p>

<p>At this moment the door flew open and Heidi sprang
across to the corner and threw her arms round grandmother.</p>

<p>"Grandmother! Grandmother! my bed is to be sent from
Frankfurt with all the three pillows and the thick coverlid;
grandmamma says it will be here in two days." Heidi could
not get out her words quickly enough, for she was impatient
to see grandmother's great joy at the news. The latter
smiled, but said a little sadly,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a></span></p>

<p>"She must indeed be a good, kind lady, and I ought to
be glad to think she is taking you with her, but I shall not
outlive it long."</p>

<p>"What is this I hear? Who has been telling my good
grandmother such tales?" exclaimed a kindly voice, and
grandmother felt her hand taken and warmly pressed, for
grandmamma had followed Heidi in and heard all that was
said. "No, no, there is no thought of such a thing! Heidi is
going to stay with you and make you happy. We want to see
her again, but we shall come to her. We hope to pay a visit to
the Alm every year, for we have good cause to offer up especial
thanks to God upon this spot where so great a miracle
has been wrought upon our child."</p>

<p>Then grandmother's face was lighted up with genuine
happiness, and she pressed Mrs. Sesemann's hand over and
over again, unable to speak her thanks, while two large tears
of joy rolled down her aged cheeks. And Heidi saw the glad
change come over grandmother's face, and she too now was
entirely happy.</p>

<p>She clung to the old woman saying, "Hasn't it all come
about, grandmother, just like the hymn I read to you last
time? Isn't the bed from Frankfurt sent to make you well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Heidi, and many, many other good things too,
which God has sent me," said the grandmother, deeply
moved. "I did not think it possible that there were so many
kind people, ready to trouble themselves about a poor old
woman and to do so much for her. Nothing strengthens our
belief in a kind heavenly Father who never forgets even the
least of His creatures so much as to know that there are such
people, full of goodness and pity for a poor, useless creature
such as I am."</p>

<p>"My good grandmother," said Mrs. Sesemann, interrupting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a></span>
her, "we are all equally poor and helpless in the eyes
of God, and all have equal need that He should not forget us.
But now we must say good-bye, but only till we meet again,
for when we pay our next year's visit to the Alm you will be
the first person we shall come and see; meanwhile we shall not
forget you." And Mrs. Sesemann took grandmother's hand
again and shook it in farewell.</p>

<p>But grandmother would not let her off even then without
more words of gratitude, and without calling down on her
benefactress and all belonging to her every blessing that
God had to bestow.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Sesemann and his mother were able to continue
their journey downwards, while Uncle carried Clara
back home, with Heidi beside him, so full of joy of what was
coming for grandmother that every step was a jump.</p>

<p>But there were many tears shed the following morning
by the departing Clara, who wept to say good-bye to the
beautiful mountain home where she had been happier than
ever before in her life. Heidi did her best to comfort her.
"Summer will be here again in no time," she said, "and then
you will come again, and it will be nicer still, for you will be
able to walk about from the beginning. We can then go out
every day with the goats up to where the flowers grow, and
enjoy ourselves from the moment you arrive."</p>

<p>Mr. Sesemann had come as arranged to take his little
daughter away, and was just now standing and talking with
Uncle, for they had much to say to one another. Clara felt
somewhat consoled by Heidi's words, and wiped away her
tears.</p>

<p>"Be sure you say good-bye for me to Peter and the goats,
and especially to Little Swan. I wish I could give Little
Swan a present, for she has helped so much to make me
strong."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you can if you like," replied Heidi, "send her a
little salt; you know how she likes to lick some out of grandfather's
hand when she comes home at night."</p>

<p>Clara was delighted at this idea. "Oh, then I shall send
a hundred pounds of salt from Frankfurt, for I want her to
have something as a remembrance of me."</p>

<p>Mr. Sesemann now beckoned to the children as it was
time to be off. Grandmamma's white horse had been brought
up for Clara, as she was no longer obliged to be carried in a
chair.</p>

<p>Heidi ran to the far edge of the slope and continued to
wave her hand to Clara until the last glimpse of horse and
rider had disappeared.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now the bed has arrived, and grandmother is sleeping
so soundly all night that she is sure to grow stronger.</p>

<p>Grandmamma Sesemann, moreover, has not forgotten
how cold the winter is on the mountain. She has sent a large
parcel of warm clothing of every description, so that the
blind grandmother can wrap herself round and round, and
will certainly not tremble with cold now as she sits in her
corner.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of building going on at Doerfli. The
doctor has arrived, and, for the present, is occupying his old
quarters. His friends have advised him to buy the old house
that Uncle and Heidi live in during the winter. The doctor
is having this part of the old house rebuilt for himself, the
other part being repaired for Uncle and Heidi, for the doctor
is aware that Uncle is a man of independent spirit, who likes
to have a house to himself. Quite at the back a warm and
well-walled stall is being put up for the two goats, and there
they will pass their winter in comfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></span></p>

<p>The two men are becoming better friends every day, and
as they walk about the new buildings to see how they are
getting on, their thoughts continually turn to Heidi, for the
chief pleasure to each in connection with the house is that
they will have the light-hearted little child with them there.</p>

<p>"Dear friend," said the doctor on one of these occasions
as they were standing together, "you will see this matter in
the same light as I do, I am sure. I share your happiness in
the child as if, next to you, I was the one to whom she most
closely belonged, but I wish also to share all responsibilities
concerning her and to do my best for the child. I shall then
feel I have my rights in her, and shall look forward to her being
with me and caring for me in my old age, which is the
one great wish of my heart. She will have the same claims
upon me as if she were my own child, and I shall provide for
her as such, and so we shall be able to leave her without
anxiety when the day comes that you and I must go."</p>

<p>Uncle did not speak, but he clasped the doctor's hand in
his, and his good friend could read in the old man's eyes how
greatly moved he was and how glad and grateful he felt.</p>

<p>Heidi and Peter were at this moment sitting with grandmother,
and the one had so much to relate, and the others to
listen to, that they all three got closer and closer to one another,
hardly able to breathe in their eagerness not to miss a
word.</p>

<p>And how much there was to tell of all the events that had
taken place that last summer, for they had not had many
opportunities of meeting since then.</p>

<p>And it was difficult to say which of the three looked the
happiest at being together again, and at the recollection of all
the wonderful things that had happened. Mother Brigitta's
face was perhaps the happiest of all, as now, with the help of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a></span>
Heidi's explanation, she was able to understand for the first
time the history of Peter's weekly dime for life.</p>

<p>Then at last the grandmother spoke, "Heidi read me one
of the hymns! I feel I can do nothing for the remainder of
my life but thank the Father in Heaven for all the mercies He
has shown us!"</p>
